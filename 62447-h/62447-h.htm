<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM.</span></h2>
<h3 id="c2">Birth and Parentage</h3>
<p>John of Antioch was born about the year 347, of
a noble family. His father, Secundus, held a high
rank in the imperial army; he died early, and left
a very young widow, in the bloom of age and
beauty, and amply endowed with wealth. Many
suitors sought to obtain the hand of St. Anthusa.
She remained faithful to the memory of her husband,
and devoted to the education of her only son. She
brought him up in all the knowledge of the age and
in strict piety, which she enforced by her example.
St. Anthusa, amid all the perils of Antioch, guarded
her son John with the same care which her contemporary,
St. Monica, bestowed in the small circle
of an African town on her Augustine. She was
happier in one thing. The heathen charms of
Antioch exerted no such power over her son John
as the like seductive beauty of Carthage exerted over
the young Augustine. The prayers and the care of
St. Monica and St. Anthusa were equally zealous.
In the one case, after the most terrible fall, lasting
over a period of at least fourteen years, the African
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
mother had the unspeakable joy of seeing her son&rsquo;s
mind delivered from the most dangerous heresy of
the day, and was allowed to die in the arms of the
new-born Christian, who could share all her hopes
of eternal life, which are recorded in the beautiful
dialogue between mother and son preserved for us
by that son, who was to be the greatest doctor of
the Church. In the other case, the Antiochene
parent to whom was applied that expression of the
admiring heathen, &lsquo;See what mothers these Christians
have,&rsquo; had the still rarer gift of rearing a son
who never fell, who pursued from beginning to end
a holy life, who was crowned with a confessorship
exceeding the glory of many martyrs, and whose
least merit is that he was the greatest preacher of
the Eastern Church, and gave to the language of
Plato, eight hundred years after him, in its decline,
a glory equal to that which the Athenian gave to it
in its prime.</p>
<p>Two men&mdash;I know not if there be any others in
all history&mdash;have had their personal name merged
by posterity in the name which expressed their
special qualities. As the son of Pepin is for ever
Charlemagne, so John, the son of St. Anthusa, is
for ever Chrysostom, the Golden Mouth. It is thus
the world calls the one great and the other eloquent.</p>
<p>To return to the facts of John of Antioch&rsquo;s life.
As he grew up he had lessons from the renowned
heathen rhetorician Libanius. He studied philosophy,
and distinguished himself, at twenty years of
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
age, in preparation for the bar. Libanius considered
him the best scholar he had, and even wished to
be succeeded by him in his office.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c3">Named Preacher at Antioch</h3>
<p>But John speedily renounced this and all worldly
renown. He practised a most strictly ascetic life,
and gave himself up to the study of the Christian religion.
He was a pupil of that Diodorus, afterwards
bishop of Tarsus, who was then held in high repute
as a Scripture commentator. He was also under
St. Meletius, patriarch of Antioch. From him he
received baptism in 369, at the age, therefore, of
twenty-two years; and the minor order of Lector
three years later. The bishops who met at Antioch
in 373 designated him, with his friend Basil, for the
episcopal dignity. In his humility he took flight to
the anchorets who dwelt in the mountains near
Antioch. With them he spent four years, and two
years after that in a cavern, until his health failed,
and he was obliged to return to Antioch. Here the
patriarch Meletius made him a deacon in 380; and
his successor Flavian gave him the priesthood in
386, in his fortieth year, and named him to be
preacher in the cathedral.</p>
<p>Then during ten years the great see of the East
wondered at the eloquence, the teaching, and the
zeal of the greatest preacher it had known. In her
sorest time of need he was at hand to comfort and
support the city of his birth. When a great riot
broke out, and led the citizens in their haste and
anger to insult the statues of the emperor Theodosius
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and his wife, the most pious Flaccilla, and Antioch
trembled lest this act of treason should be followed
by summary destruction; when her patriarch Flavian
hurried across the five hundred miles to Constantinople,
that if possible he might soften the wrath of
the emperor before the bolt was launched, St.
Chrysostom preached some of his most famous
sermons, those entitled, &lsquo;On the Statues&rsquo;. He
kept up the courage of the fainting people, and
when Flavian returned with a pardon which left
untouched the privileges of the city, the preacher
shared with the patriarch the gratitude of those who
were saved.</p>
<p>After ten years of incessant labours by the
preacher, which form a large part of the writings
preserved to us, the see of Constantinople fell vacant
by the death of the patriarch Nectarius. Theodosius
had died in 395, leaving the great eastern
empire in the hands of his elder son Arcadius,
scarcely out of his boyhood. The young emperor
was unwilling to trust the see of his capital to any
one of his clergy, and he listened to the advice given
to him to call from Antioch the man whose genius
was as great as his character was stainless. The
great officer who carried out the imperial invitation,
or command, at Antioch, was obliged to use artifice
for the purpose of securing the preacher. His people
would not knowingly have suffered him to leave
them. He was taken out of the city under a
plausible pretence. &lsquo;Asterius, count of the East,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
had orders to send for him and ask his company to
a church without the city. Having got him into
his carriage, he drove off with him to the first
station on the high road to Constantinople, where
imperial officers were in readiness to convey him
thither.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Thus he was carried across Asia with
all possible speed. Upon his arrival at Constantinople
he was chosen bishop with one voice, and
consecrated on the 26th February, 398. His consecrator
was Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria,
who very unwillingly performed this office. He had
striven to get a certain priest who was devoted to
himself appointed. His subsequent enmity to St.
Chrysostom was a main cause of the banishment
and death which befel the man whom he had consecrated.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c4">Archbishop of Constantinople</h3>
<p>Thus, at fifty years of age, St. Chrysostom was
placed, not only without seeking for it, but against
his wishes, upon that see which, through the residence
of the emperor, was already become the most
conspicuous of episcopal thrones in the East. From
the moment that Constantine, sixty-seven years
before, had made Byzantium Nova Roma, and
founded, in fact, a new empire, all the ambitious
spirits among the prelates of the East sought to
seat themselves on that perilous height. This new
centre of temporal power was from that time forth
the centre of trouble, heresy, and disaster to the
Church. Eusebius left his former see, Nicomedia,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
to possess it, and to be the emperor&rsquo;s bishop. One
after another Arian heretics succeeded. In 379,
when the small number of Catholics remaining in
the new capital invited St. Gregory Nazienzen to
come to their aid, he could only open in a private
room a small church, which he called by the significant
name of Anastasia, the Resurrection. In that
year Theodosius was promoted by the young Gratian
to share his throne, upon the destruction of his
uncle Valens by the Goths. Valens had all but
destroyed both empire and Church in the East. It
was the great effort of Theodosius to restore both.
In fifteen years of unexampled energy, terrible trials,
and almost miraculous success, he did what valour,
piety, and prudence could do. These years were all
that the Divine Providence had allowed him for a
work almost transcending human power; and when
he died, not yet fifty years old, in 395, the great
empire of Rome, both in East and West, may be
said to have fallen into orphanage. His two sons,
Arcadius and Honorius, one a youth of nineteen
and the other a boy of eleven, proved to be utterly
incompetent. Even Theodosius had failed to overcome
the deep degeneracy and rooted party spirit to
which the Arian heresy had reduced the eastern
episcopate when St. Athanasius and St. Basil had
been freshly laid in their tombs. The council called
by Theodosius at Constantinople in 381 suffered St.
Gregory to give up the see, which was surrounded
by envious rivals. For when Meletius, the patriarch
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
of Antioch, died, in presiding over that council, instead
of extinguishing the Antiochene schism by the
election of Paulinus, the bishop who was already in
communion with Rome and Alexandria, according
to an actual agreement, they suffered the schism to
be prolonged by the election of Flavian. Nectarius
took the place which St. Gregory had vacated, and
St. Chrysostom was called after about fifteen years
to succeed to his patriarchate.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c5">State of Constantinople</h3>
<p>Such was the state of things when, in 398, he began
the charge of a city which, in corruption, party spirit,
and unquenched enmities of long-standing, surpassed,
if it were possible, his own native Antioch. It is
true, that instead of the small remnant who listened
to St. Gregory eighteen years before in the Church of
the Resurrection, the whole city was, in name at
least, Catholic. Its bishop was seated in a magnificent
church, with a clergy more numerous,
perhaps, than in any episcopal see in the world:
with vast revenues, and a position second only to
that of the emperor. But the court of the East was
the focus of endless rivalries: of eunuchs who were
ministers of state exercising the terrible autocratic
powers of an emperor scarcely of age, and dominated
by an imperious empress, whose splendid beauty
held him in thraldom, while her lust of power was
endless and her vanity excessive. And then there
were foreign and barbarian generals, whose struggle
with each other for mastery was always keeping the
empire in disquietude. And lastly, the rivalry of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Gallic Rufinus, whom Theodosius had left to advise
his son in the East with the semi-barbarian Stilicho,
to whom he had given both his favourite niece
Serena for wife, and his younger son Honorius for
pupil in the West, was preparing the ruin of
Constantine&rsquo;s empire by its own hands.</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere the preacher and the saint
was placed to struggle as he might against court
intrigues, and to correct and purify a clergy whose
conduct left much to be desired. He showed himself
throughout an admirable bishop. Pursuing himself
the most simple and ascetic life, he bestowed his
whole great income as patriarch on the poor. He
founded hospitals and homes. He celebrated the
divine service with the utmost care and splendour.
He watched over discipline among his clergy. He
was unwearied in preaching. Nor did his vigilance
end with the limits of his own see. He sent
missionaries to Ph&oelig;nicia and Palestine; to the
Scythians, also, and the Goths. For the latter he
established a special service of their own&mdash;he did all
he could to deliver them from the fatal error which
the deceit of the emperor Valens had infected them
with, in presenting them with Arianism instead of
the Christian faith. He exerted also the very
questionable claim of his see&mdash;which the council of
381 had attempted to exalt to the utmost&mdash;by
judging the case of the Exarch of Ephesus, and
removing several faulty bishops from their seats in
that exarchate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c6">Enmity of Eudoxia</h3>
<p>But the &lsquo;Court&rsquo;s stern martyr-guest,&rsquo; who was
also &lsquo;the glorious preacher with soul of zeal and
lips of flame,&rsquo; could not go on long practising the
life of a saint with the power of a patriarch under
such sovereigns as the weak Arcadius and the
imperious Eudoxia. His virtues offended many in a
city of intense worldliness. His censures, delivered
with his wonted eloquence from the pulpit of the
cathedral, roused great enmities. In Theophilus,
patriarch of Alexandria, he had a watchful enemy,
eager to punish, in the person of Chrysostom, the
new rank which his see arrogated of being the second
in the Church, as the see of Nova Roma. By that
arrogation, the see of St. Mark at Alexandria was
degraded from a rank which it had held since the
beginning of the Christian hierarchy. Not only
among the magnates of the court, but among his
brother bishops, Chrysostom found much opposition:
and at last the empress set herself at the head of his
opponents. While he was absent in Asia Minor,
restoring to order the exarchate of Ephesus,
Severian, bishop of Gabala in Syria, sought, by
sermons delivered in the cathedral itself, to take
from him the favour of the people. But it received
him with acclamation on his return, and drove
Severian out of the city.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c7">Synod of the Oak</h3>
<p>But certain disturbances about the doctrine of
Origen which had broken out among the monks
in Egypt involved him in unfortunate difficulties.
Among many monks who fled to Constantinople
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
from the desert of Nitria in Egypt, under excommunication
from Theophilus, were the &lsquo;four tall
brothers&rsquo;. They came to accuse their patriarch
before the emperor and Chrysostom. He took them
up, showing kindness and sympathy, though he did
not admit them to communion. Theophilus was
summoned to Constantinople by the emperor, to
answer for his conduct before a synod. To escape
this humiliation he used every effort to ruin Chrysostom,
whom he took to be his own opponent. He
accused Chrysostom himself of Origenism. This
scheme of the Egyptian patriarch brought over to
his side all the opponents of Chrysostom at the
court. Theophilus even ventured to appear as the
accuser and judge of the patriarch in the capital
itself. He was able to draw together a synod of
thirty-six bishops at the Oak, a country-house near
Chalcedon, and to summon the bishop of Constantinople
to appear before it. Chrysostom, on the
double ground of his own rank and his innocence,
refused to appear. The unlawful synod &lsquo;of the
Oak&rsquo; condemned him, supported by the influence
of the empress. Forty bishops around him in
Constantinople attested his innocence, and objected
to a proceeding utterly unlawful and, until then,
unknown. Chrysostom was willing to obey a command
of the emperor that he should cross the
Bosphorus and attend; but the people threatened
insurrection if the command were not withdrawn.
Chrysostom had to return, and was reseated in
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
his church with the joyful acclamation of his
people.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c8">Exile at Kucusus</h3>
<p>Not long did the peace last. A statue of the
empress had been inaugurated before the cathedral.
The crowd indulged in most intemperate rejoicings,
and paid almost idolatrous homage to the statue.
This Chrysostom, in preaching, censured. The
empress took the blame to herself: it kindled her
wrath afresh. It was whispered to her that the
great preacher had alluded to her under the name of
Herodias. A new synod of the patriarch&rsquo;s opponents
was convoked. It issued, in the year 404, a second
sentence of deposition against him. It alleged that
Chrysostom, after being deposed by a synod, had,
contrary to the law of the Church, resumed his
see without being restored by another synod. The
emperor Arcadius confirmed the decision, and subscribed
a decree of banishment. This time Chrysostom
waited for force to be used. Soldiers were sent
into the church: they pushed aside the people who
were protecting their bishop. Blood flowed, and
the church was desecrated.</p>
<p>Chrysostom was carried away to Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia,
and was ordered, in the midst of the summer
heats, to go thence on foot, amid the greatest privations
and hardships, to Kucusus in Armenia. The
journey brought on him a grievous illness. Thus
he was detained for some time at C&aelig;sarea in
Cappadocia. He was scarcely recovered when he
was driven further on. In 406, he reached Kucusus.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
But he kept up intercourse by letter with his friends
in the capital. Arsacius, in the meantime, had been
intruded by the emperor&rsquo;s power into his see; and
a grievous persecution was instituted against those
who would not recognise the intruder. Chrysostom
consoled them in many letters. Banished as he
was, he concerned himself for the spread of the
faith among Persians and Goths. His sufferings,
and the magnanimity with which he bore them,
won for him sympathy far and wide. But his
enemies remained unmoved. He besought the
intercession of Pope Innocent I., describing to
him, in a letter which is translated in this volume,
the utter illegality of the violence which he was
suffering. The Pope applied to the emperor
Honorius for succour, and was supported by him
in sending a solemn deputation to the emperor
Arcadius; but he was under the dominion of the
offended Eudoxia, and refused to listen either to
his brother emperor or the Pope.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c9">Judgment of Pope Innocent I.</h3>
<p>The Pope withdrew his communion from the
intruder Arsacius, who had been put unlawfully in
the see of Chrysostom, and from his successor
Atticus; and for many years this mark of reprobation
was all that the Pope could do in the difficult
circumstances of the times. It lasted until the name
of Chrysostom was replaced in the diptychs of the
Church at Constantinople.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c10">Comana</h3>
<p>But Arcadius went further, and condemned Chrysostom
to a more distant and ruder exile at Pityus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
a seaport on the most desolate eastern coast of the
Euxine. In the utmost summer heat, with exhausted
strength, the deposed patriarch had to
undertake this journey. He never reached the end.
His merciless guards pressed his weakness to the
utmost. When at Comana he thought his end was
near; but the guards urged him on. For an hour
he could drag himself along; then his strength
utterly failed. He was taken into the small church
of the Martyr Basiliscus, which was near. His
friend and biographer, the Bishop Palladius, thus
describes the last scene:</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c11">His Death</h3>
<p>&lsquo;In that very night (that is, at Comana) the
martyr of the place stood before him, Basiliscus by
name, who had been bishop of Comana, and died by
martyrdom in Nicomedia in the reign of Maximinus,
together with Lucian of Bithynia, who had been a
priest of Antioch. And he said, &ldquo;Be of good heart,
brother John, for to-morrow we shall be together&rdquo;.
It is said that the martyr had already made the
same announcement to the priest of the place:
&ldquo;Prepare the place for brother John, for he is
coming&rdquo;. And John, believing the divine oracle,
upon the morrow besought his guards to remain
there until the fifth hour. They refused, and set
forward; but, when they had proceeded about thirty
stadia, he was so ill that they returned back to the
martyr&rsquo;s shrine whence they had started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he got there, he asked for white vestments
suitable to the tenor of his past life; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
taking off his clothes of travel, he clad himself in
them from head to foot, being still fasting, and then
gave away his old ones to them about him. Then,
having communicated in the symbols of the Lord,
he made the closing prayer &ldquo;on present needs&rdquo;. He
said his customary words, &ldquo;Glory be to God for all
things,&rdquo; and having concluded it with his last Amen,
he stretched forth those feet of his which had been
so beautiful in their running, whether to convey
salvation to the penitent or reproof to the hardened
in sin. And being gathered to his fathers, and
shaking off this mortal dust, he passed to Christ, as
it is written, &ldquo;Thou shalt come to thy burial like
full wheat that is harvested in season, but the souls
of transgressors shall die prematurely&rdquo;. But so
great a crowd of virgins, ascetics, and those who
had the witness of sanctity in their life were present
from Syria, Cilicia, Pontus, and Armenia, that many
thought they had come by agreement. With these
solemn rites, like a victorious athlete, he was buried
in the same shrine with Basiliscus.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, the empress Eudoxia had
passed away in child-bed before her victim. In the
undimmed lustre of her beauty, and the undiminished
power of her will over her husband, she
had been called to her account. Her husband, the
emperor Arcadius, died not long after. He finished
an utterly inglorious reign of twelve years at the age
of thirty-one. His miserable government had gone
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
near to destroy the empire which his father saved,
and had actually thrown Alaric with his Goths upon
Rome and Italy. He was succeeded by Theodosius
II., a boy eight years old.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c12">Translation of his Body</h3>
<p>Thirty years after, a disciple and friend of Chrysostom
sat in the see of Nova Roma, the orthodox
Proclus, who was a theologian and a saint. He
moved the emperor Theodosius II. to bring back
the body of Chrysostom to its place among the
bishops in the Church of the Apostles, where only
the bishops and the emperors were buried&mdash;the
former in the church, the latter in the vestibule.
Theodoret, bishop of Cyrus at the time, says: &lsquo;A
great multitude of the faithful crowded the sea in
vessels, and lighted up a part of the Bosphorus near
the mouth of the Propontis with torches. These
sacred treasures were brought to the city by the
present emperor. He laid his face upon the coffin,
and entreated that his parents might be forgiven for
having so unadvisedly persecuted the bishop.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c13">Final Burial at St. Peter&rsquo;s</h3>
<p>Those remains now rest in a fitter place. St.
Chrysostom, in words quoted further on, when
dilating as a fervent lover of St. Paul upon his
praise, cried out: &lsquo;Rome, for this do I love,
although having reason otherwise to praise her, both
for her size, and her antiquity, and her beauty, and
her multitude, and her power, and her wealth, and
her victories in war. But passing by all these
things, for this I count her blessed: because, when
alive, Paul wrote to them, and loved them so much,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
and went and conversed with them, and there
finished his life. Wherefore the city is on that
account more remarkable than for all other things
together, and like a great and strong body, it has
two shining eyes&mdash;the bodies of these saints. Not
so bright is the heaven when the sun sends forth
his beams, as is the city of the Romans sending
forth everywhere over the world these two lights.
Thence shall Paul, thence shall Peter, be caught up.
Think, and tremble, what a sight shall Rome
behold, when Paul suddenly rises from that resting-place
with Peter, and is carried up to meet the
Lord. What a rose doth Rome offer to Christ!
with what two garlands is that city crowned! with
what golden fetters is she girdled! what fountains
does she possess! Therefore do I admire that city,
not for the multitude of its gold, nor for its columns,
nor for its other splendours, but for these, the pillars
of the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The body, therefore, of him who spoke these
words, while a preacher at Antioch, rests more
fitly than in any other place amid that matchless
group of apostles, saints, and martyrs which surrounds
the body of the Fisherman, in the central
shrine of Christendom. There he awaits the sight
which he anticipated with so much joy.</p>
<p>I must notice one more fact of the eight great
brethren, the chief doctors of the East and West.
St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Gregory
the Great, St. Athanasius, St. Basil, St. Gregory
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Nazianzen, and himself, all suffered persecution;
the life of St. Athanasius was for years in danger
from the bitter hatred of the emperor Constantius,
and the emperor Valens would have destroyed St.
Basil, had he dared. But to Chrysostom alone was
given actually to lay down his life itself for justice&rsquo;
sake, and to follow St. John the Baptist not only in
sanctity of life and preaching the cross of Christ,
but in his death through the persecution of a
woman, and the blinded tyranny of a king devoted
to her will.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c14">Summary of his Works</h3>
<p>It may be well to give here a summary of St.
Chrysostom&rsquo;s works. Very much of his labour he
spent in commenting upon Scripture. This took
the form of homilies, of which the larger part was
delivered before the people in Antioch. He belongs
to the Antiochene school of literal explanation.
He was a fellow-pupil under Diodorus of Tarsus,
with that Theodorus, afterwards bishop of Mopsuestia,
whose writings were the fountain-head of
what was afterwards called Nestorianism. They
were composed exactly at the same time as those of
St. Augustine, and were as prolific for evil as those
of St. Augustine for good. But the piety and
accurate doctrine of St. Chrysostom preserved him
from the errors of his early comrade and friend.
His homilies in their structure may be divided into
the careful expounding of the text, even to its
particles, and then the moral application, both in
popular yet scientific form, finished with such skill
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
that the art of eloquence seems blended with that of
exposition in the fairest union.</p>
<p>He thus expounded the whole of Genesis in sixty-seven
homilies; the Psalms in sixty homilies; the
prophet Isaias, but only to the middle of the 8th
chapter, according to both the historical and the
mystical sense. There are five discourses on St.
Anne, the mother of Samuel; three on David and
Saul; two on the obscurity of the prophets; six
upon the seraphim, in which he speaks on the
incomprehensibility of the Divine Being. To the
gospel of St. Matthew he has given ninety homilies,
so skilfully interweaving Christian doctrine with
literal exposition that, in Montfaucon&rsquo;s opinion, no
such work exists elsewhere; and St. Thomas
Aquinas is reported to have said that he would
rather have it than the city of Paris. He has given
seven homilies to the history of Lazarus and Dives
in St. Luke; and eighty-eight homilies to the gospel
of St. John, shorter, however, than those on St.
Matthew. To the Acts of the Apostles he has given
fifty-five homilies, delivered at Constantinople, and
written down by shorthand. To the epistles of St.
Paul he has given two hundred and forty-six homilies;
which make up the number of four hundred and
eighty-six on the whole New Testament.</p>
<p>All these are counted among his best works: but
the best of all, those on the Pauline epistles, particularly
that to the Romans. St. Isidore of Pelusium
says: &lsquo;I believe if Paul had interpreted himself in
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Attic phrase, he would have done it no otherwise
than this distinguished holy teacher. So admirable
is his exposition in meaning, elegance, and choice of
words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Besides biblical exposition, St. Chrysostom has
left a great number of other discourses on various
occasions.</p>
<p>Such are eight homilies against the Jews; twelve
against the Anom&aelig;ans, the worst branch of the
Arians. Discourses on the great festivals; panegyrics
on saints, among them on bishops of Antioch,
Ignatius, Babylas, Philogonius, Eustathius, and
Meletius. Seven on the Apostle Paul, held at
Antioch, whom he seems to have chosen for his
model: to have read perpetually, and, as it were, to
have seen at his side.</p>
<p>Of occasional discourses, there are twenty-one
&lsquo;On the Statues&rsquo; held at Antioch in the Lent of
387, full of tenderness and the most stirring eloquence.
Of moral discourses, there are two to
&lsquo;those about to be illuminated,&rsquo; that is, baptised:
nine upon penance. Eleven at Constantinople in
398 and 399, one of these in praise of the empress
Eudoxia when she came at night to Sancta Sophia
to venerate the relics of the martyrs; nine others
on various subjects.</p>
<p>Among his dogmatic works are the demonstration
against the Jews that Christ is God, proving the
divine dignity of the Messias from the fulfilment of
Old Testament prophecies, from the wonderful spread
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
of the Christian faith, from the fulfilment of the
prophecies of Christ, especially on the temple and
the Jewish people: the writing on St. Babylas,
and against Julian and the heathen. He points out
how the miracles worked at Antioch in Julian&rsquo;s
attack on Daphne were a warning to the restorer of
heathenism, disregarding which, he was punished by
an early death. A treatise on two books to Theodorus,
when he lapsed, the Theodorus mentioned
above: on compunction, two books: on Providence,
three books, to a friend grievously troubled.
To the opposers of the monastic life, three books:
the comparison between a monk and a king: on
the priesthood, six books, written in solitude, in 376.
It dwells on the holiness and exalted character of
the New Testament priesthood: on its divine
powers in offering the sacrifice and forgiving sins;
on the difficulty and the dangers of preaching; on
the great qualities required by a priest and a bishop.
So he excuses himself to his friend Basil for
recommending him to an office which he fled from
himself. A treatise on the virginal life, which he
gives only as a counsel, not as a precept, recognising
the honour due to marriage. Two books to a young
widow, advising her not to remarry. Against the
prohibited dwelling of unmarried women in the
same house with priests, and a most beautiful
treatise upon &lsquo;No one can be hurt except by
himself,&rsquo; written in the last moments of his own
banishment, of which his own life and death is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
best assurance; and a like one &lsquo;on those who are
scandalised at misfortunes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lastly, we possess 238 letters, all but one called
forth by the incidents of his own banishment.
These show the holy confessor in the whole beauty
of his magnanimous life. They are instinct throughout
with trust in the Divine Providence, like the
last words which he uttered when he lay down to
die.</p>
<p>Out of this vast mass of works, the largest left to
us by any Greek Father, the Translator has ventured
to make a small selection, which, together
with the translation itself, is entirely her own; and
for which her excuse is the desire to bring in the
easiest form specimens of so great a writer, and of
one greater yet in deed than in writing, greatest of all
in his death, before some who know him rather by
the reputation he has left in the Church than by his
actual words.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>

<p>Is not it with justice, then, that He turns away
from us and chastises us, since in everything He
is offering us Himself, and we are resisting Him?
This is clear to all. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;if you wish
to adorn yourself you have My adornment, or to
arm yourself you have My arms, or to dress yourself
you have My clothing, or to eat you have My table,
or to walk you have My road, or to inherit you have
My inheritance, or to go into your own country you
have that city of which I am the Builder and the
Architect, or to build a house you have My tents.
I do not demand of you a reward for the things
which I give, but I owe interest to you besides for
that reward if you are willing to make use of all that
is Mine.&rsquo; What could equal this munificence? &lsquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
am father, I am brother, I am bridegroom, I am
dwelling-place; I am food, I am clothing, I am root
and foundation; I am all things whatsoever you
desire: stand in need of no man. I will also be a
slave, for I came to minister, not to be ministered
to. I am a friend too; I am member and head,
and brother, and sister, and mother; I am all
things; only hold Me for your own. I am poor for
you, and a wanderer for you; I was on the cross for
you, and in the tomb for you; I intercede with the
Father for you up above, and I came down to earth
as a messenger to you from the Father. You are
all things to Me&mdash;brother and co-heir, and friend
and member.&rsquo; What more do you ask? Why do
you turn away from Him, your Lover? Why do
you labour for the world? Why do you pour water
into a broken pitcher? For this is to toil for the
life which now is. Why do you spin a web for
burning? Why beat the air? Why run at random?
Has not every art an object? This is clear
to everyone. Show me, then, you also, the object
of your labour in life. You have none.</p>
<p><i>Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.</i> Let us go
into a churchyard; show me now your father, show
me your wife. Where is he who was clothed in
gold? Where is he who rode in his chariot?
Where is he who had an army at his command, he
who had a treasury, and he who held a public
office? Where is he who killed some and cast
others into prison, who slew whom he pleased and
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
acquitted whom he pleased? I see nothing except
bones, and the moth and the cobweb; all those
things were dust and fable, and dream and shadow,
and idle talk and an epitaph&mdash;indeed, not even an
epitaph, for we see an epitaph on a figure, but in
this place not even a figure. And would that evils
ended here! Now, that which pertains to honour
and feasting and great name is like a shadow and
idle talk, but that which they produce is by no
means a shadow or idle talk. Their effects remain,
and will abide with us there and be evident to all&mdash;rapacity
and selfishness, fornication, adultery, and a
thousand vices of the same kind. These are not in
the image nor in the ashes, but both words and
deeds are written above. With what eyes, then,
shall we look upon Christ? For if a man would not
venture to see his father if he were conscious in his
own mind of sinning against him, how shall we in
that hour confront Him Who is infinitely gentler
than a father? How shall we bear Him? For we
shall stand before the tribunal of Christ, and there
will be a strict scrutiny of all things. But if anyone
disbelieve in that future judgment, let him consider
things as they are on earth&mdash;those in prisons, for
instance, those in mines and on dung-hills, possessed
men, madmen, those who are fighting with incurable
disease, those who are pinched by persistent poverty,
those who are mated with hunger, those who are
given over to unhealable sorrow, those who are in
captivity. Men, indeed, would not now suffer these
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
things if He did not ordain that reward and punishment
should await all those who have been guilty of
the like transgressions. And if these men incur no
penalty in this world, you must take this to yourself
as a sign that there is to be something in the next
after our departure hence. For He Who is the
Lord of all would not chastise some and leave
others, who had been guilty of the same or of
worse things, unchastised, if He did not reserve a
punishment for them in the next world.</p>

<h3 id="c16"><span class="sc">Who is the Greater?</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lviii., vol. ii., p. 167.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who,
then, is the greater in the kingdom of heaven?</i> The
disciples had a human feeling, this is why the
Evangelist lays special stress upon it, saying, <i>at that
time</i>&mdash;that is, when He had singled out Peter for
special honour. For in the case of James and John
one was the first-born, but He did nothing of the
kind for them. As, then, they are ashamed to own
to their annoyance, they do not say openly: &lsquo;Why
hast Thou honoured Peter more than us?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Is he
greater than we?&rsquo; they would not say this, but ask
indefinitely: <i>Who is the greater?</i> When they saw
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the three singled out for special honour, they had
felt nothing of the kind; they <i>were</i> grieved, however,
when so great a distinction was conferred upon one.
This was not all, for their feeling was intensified by
putting many other favours together. For Our Lord
said to him: <i>I will give thee the keys, and, Blessed art
thou, Simon Bar Jona</i>, and again, <i>Give it to them for Me
and thee</i>; and, seeing Peter&rsquo;s great fearlessness, they
were irritated. And if Mark says that they did not
put their question, but thought it in their own
minds, this is not in any way contrary to Matthew&rsquo;s
account. For it is probable that they did both one
and the other, both that they felt this at one time,
and that at another they spoke out, and also had
their own thoughts about it. Now, do not look
merely at the accusation, but consider further, first,
that they are not seeking earthly things, and
secondly, that they afterwards overcame this
feeling, and ceded the first places to each other.
We, on the contrary, are neither able to reach their
defects, nor do we seek who is the greater in the
kingdom of heaven, but who is the greater in the
kingdom of the world, who is the richer and the
more powerful.</p>
<p>Now, what does Christ say? He reveals their
conscience to them, and answers this feeling rather
than their mere words. <i>Calling unto Him a little child,
He said: Unless you be converted and become as little
children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i>
&lsquo;You, indeed, enquire who is the greater, and dispute
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
about the first places; <i>I</i> tell you that he who has
not become meeker than all the rest is not worthy
even to enter into that kingdom.&rsquo; And He brings
the example before them in a beautiful way; and
not only does He bring it before them, but He sets
the child in the midst of them, admonishing them
by the sight, and urging them to be both humble and
unaffected. For a child is free from envy and from
vainglory, and from the love of the first places, and
he possesses the greatest virtue&mdash;simplicity, and unaffectedness
and humility. It is not sufficient to
have courage and prudence, but this virtue also: I
mean humility and simplicity. For with the
greatest, our salvation will be at fault, if we have
not these. Contempt, blows, honour, or praise cause
a child neither annoyance nor envy, nor is he thereby
inflated. Do you see again how He excites us to
natural qualities, showing us that these may be
rightly directed by a free choice, and how He thus
condemns the wretched fury of the Manicheans?
For if nature be bad, why does He take from nature
illustrations in favour of asceticism? The child
seems to me most truly a child standing in the
midst of them, free from all these passions. Such a
child, indeed, is without folly, and the love of
reputation, without jealousy and envy, and every
affection of the kind; and having many virtues&mdash;simplicity,
humility, unmeddlesomeness&mdash;he is not
puffed up by any one of them; it is doubly wise to
possess these things and not to be vain of them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
This is why Our Lord called the child and set him
in the midst of them; nor did He close His
argument here, but He adds this further exhortation,
saying: <i>He who shall receive one of these children in
My name receives Me</i>. &lsquo;Not only if you have become
like to them shall you have a great reward, but also
if you honour those like them for My sake, I will
give you a kingdom as a reward for your honour of
them.&rsquo; He says, indeed, more than this in the
words <i>receives Me</i>. Thus, ardently am I to desire
meekness and unaffectedness. Hence He calls men
who ate thus simple and humble, and cast off by
the multitude, and despised, children.</p>

<p>Let no sinner despair: let no just man give way
to sloth. Neither let the just be presumptuous, for
it often happens that the harlot outstrips him; nor
let the sinner be downcast, for he may overtake
those who are first.</p>
<p>Listen to what God says to Jerusalem: <i>I said
all these things after her adultery, Turn to Me, and
she did not turn</i>. As often as we return to the
burning charity of God, He no longer remembers
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
our former sins. God is not as man: He does not
reproach those who come to Him, or say, if we be
really changed, &lsquo;Why hast thou wasted so much
time?&rsquo; but He loves us whenever we go to Him.
Let us only go to Him in the right way. Let us
cling fast to Him, and nail our hearts to His fear.
These things have taken place not only recently,
but they happened also of old. What was worse
than Manasses? Yet he was able to appease God.
Who was more blessed than Solomon? But torpor
made him fall. Indeed, I can show the two things
happening in one man; in Solomon&rsquo;s father, for he
himself was just and became wicked. Who was
more blessed than Judas? Yet Judas became a
traitor. What could be more miserable than
Matthew? But he became an evangelist. What
was worse than Paul? Still, Paul became an
apostle. Who was more zealous than Simon? And
yet Simon himself became the most wretched of all.
How many more of the same vicissitudes would you
contemplate&mdash;those both of the past and those
which are taking place every day? So I say,
neither let the man who is on the stage despair,
nor let the man who is in the Church make too
bold. To the latter it was said: <i>He who seems to
stand, let him be careful lest he fall</i>, and to the
former: <i>Does the fallen man not rise up again?</i> and,
<i>Restore languid hands and disabled knees</i>. Again, to
the just it was said: <i>Watch</i>, but to sinners: <i>Arise,
thou who sleepest, and rise from the dead</i>. The former
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
have need to watch over what they possess, and the
latter to become that which they are not as yet:
the just to preserve their health, sinners to put off
their sickness. For they <i>are</i> sick, but many of the
sick are sound, and some of the sound, by their
carelessness, become sick. For it was to these that
Our Lord said, <i>Go, thou art sound: sin no more, lest
something worse should befal thee</i>; but to sinners,
<i>Wilt thou be made sound? Take up thy bed and walk,
and go into thy house.</i> Sin is indeed a dire paralysis,
or, rather, it is not only a paralysis, but something
more fearful. For a paralysed man is not only
lacking good things, but is also a prey to bad ones.
Still, if you are even in this state, and are willing to
make a small effort to rise, all sins are remitted.
Even if your sickness has lasted thirty-eight years,
yet you strive to become sound: there is no one
to prevent you. Christ is at hand now as then, and
He says, <i>Take up thy bed</i>. Only be willing to rise;
do not lose heart. Have you no man? You have
God. Have you no one to put you into the pool?
But you have One Who will not allow you to
require the pool in vain. Have you no one to hold
you in it? You have One Who commands you to
take up your bed. You have not to say, <i>When I
come, another gets down before me</i>. For if you wish to
go down to the fountain no man hinders you.
Charity is not spent nor consumed: it is a source
which is always flowing upwards: out of His fulness
we are all cured as to our soul and as to our
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
body. Now, therefore, also, let us approach Him.
Rahab was a harlot, yet she was saved; and the
thief was a murderer, but he became a citizen of
paradise; and Judas, being in the society of the
Master, was lost, whilst the thief on the cross became
a disciple. These are God&rsquo;s paradoxes. Thus
it was that the Magi found favour, that a publican
became an evangelist, and a blasphemer an apostle.</p>
<p>Consider these things, and never despair, but be
of good heart always, and raise yourself up. Keep
to that path alone which leads above, and you will
make rapid progress. Close not the doors nor block
up the entrance. This time is short and the labour
small. And if it were heavy, even then we should
not refuse it. For if you are not weary with this
most delicious weariness of wisdom and virtue, you
will be weary with the weariness of the world, and
will be worn out in another way. But if there be
weariness here too, why do we not choose for ourselves
that other which is so productive of fruit and
has so great a reward? And yet this last weariness
is not as the former. For in worldly things there
are always risks and continuous penalties: hope is
uncertain, much slavery of spirit is required, and
there is expenditure of money, and of strength of
body and of mind, and even then the compensation
of results is far below the expectation, if there be
any results at all. The sweat and toil of worldly
business do not, indeed, in all cases produce fruit.
Even in those instances in which they are not fruitless,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
but rich in results, these are short-lived. For
it is when you grow old, and have no longer an
acute sense of enjoyment that your labour yields its
fruit. The hard work falls to the lot of the body at
its prime, whereas the fruit and its enjoyment come
when it is worn and aged, and time has dulled its
perceptions, or, if it has not dulled them, the prospect
of an approaching end forbids enjoyment. It is not so
in the other case, but labour is the part of a mortal
and corruptible body, and the crown belongs to a
glorified and immortal one which is eternal. The
labour comes first and is slight, but the reward
comes last and is infinite, so that you may rest with
security and be untroubled as to the future. There
is no fear of change or of misfortune as there is here
on earth. What goods, then, are these&mdash;insecure,
slight, and earthly, which disappear before they
appear, and are possessed with so much toil? How
are they equal to those immutable, undecaying good
things which are free from all hardships, and crown
you in the time of warfare? The man who despises
money receives his reward even on earth: he is free
from care and envy, slander, treachery, and heart-burnings.
The wise man, he who lives decorously,
is crowned and in luxury before his flight hence,
in his freedom from unseemliness and senseless
laughter, and dangers and accusations, and all evils.
In the same way, virtue, of whatever other kind,
puts us already in possession of our reward. Let us
then, fly from evil and choose the good, so that we
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
may arrive at both present and future rewards.
Thus we shall both enjoy our lives here and possess
our crowns in heaven, which may it be given to us
all to do through the love and mercy of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory and power for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><i>One and the same Spirit worketh all things, distributing
to each his own gifts according to His pleasure.</i> Therefore
he says, let us not be troubled or grieved, thinking
to ourselves, &lsquo;Why have I received this and not
received that?&rsquo; Neither must we scrutinise the
doings of the Holy Spirit. For if you know that He
has shown you favour out of kindness, considering
that out of the same kindness He has also put a limit
to His gift, acquiesce and rejoice in what you have
received, and be not down-hearted about what you
have not received, but rather give thanks that your
gift is not beyond your power. If it behoves us not
to be over-eager in spiritual things, how much less
in those of the flesh; but we should be at ease, and
not be disturbed because one man is rich and another
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
poor. In the first place, not every rich man gets
his wealth from God, but many become rich through
injustice and avarice and graspingness. For how
could He, Who commands us not to lay up riches,
have given that which He prohibited our taking?
Now, in order that I may silence those who differ
from us in this with the more authority, let us go
deeper into the argument. Tell me why were riches
given by God? Why was it that Abraham was rich,
and that Jacob even wanted bread? Were not both
righteous men? Had not God said equally of the
three, <i>I am the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of
Jacob</i>? Why then was the one rich and the other
in poverty? Or, rather, why was Esau, the unjust
and fratricidal man, rich, and Jacob in servitude for
so long? Again, why did Isaac pass his whole life
in ease, and Jacob in toils and hardships, so that he
said, <i>My days are short and miserable</i>? Why did David,
too, being both prophet and king, as he was, live his
life in labour, whilst his son Solomon was, during
forty years, the richest of men, in the enjoyment of
enduring peace, glory, and honour, and every possible
luxury? Why, in short, amongst the prophets was
one tried more and another less? Because thus it
was profitable to each. Therefore, every man should
say, <i>Thy judgments are a deep abyss</i>. For if God exercised
those great and admirable men in different
ways&mdash;one through poverty, another through riches;
one by a life of ease, another by tribulation&mdash;it behoves
us all the more to take the same lesson now
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
to heart. Together with these considerations, we
must admit that many things happen to us, which
are not according to His judgment, but the result of
our own wickedness. Say not, then, &lsquo;Why is it
that a man is rich, being bad, and another man is
poor, being just?&rsquo; We may easily explain this, and
say that neither does the just man suffer any harm
from his poverty, which is a source of greater merit
to him, and that the unjust man, unless he be converted,
possesses in his riches a store of wrath, and
that, in place of chastisement, the riches of many
men have often been the cause of evil to them, and
led them into a thousand abysses. But God leaves
them these riches, showing everywhere the free
action of divine choice, everywhere teaching other
men not to fight nor to strive for money. &lsquo;What,
then,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;if a bad man becomes rich, and suffers
no harm? If a righteous man were to become rich,
it would be just, but what are we to say when a bad
man does?&rsquo; That on this account he is to be pitied.
For wealth added to wickedness increases the intensity
of passions. But a man is just, and he is
starving. Well, it does him no harm. But he is
bad, and starving. Well, he has his just deserts, or,
rather, what is for his good. &lsquo;But so and so,&rsquo; you
say, &lsquo;received his wealth from ancestors, and has
squandered it on bad women and parasites, and he
is none the worse.&rsquo; How is this? Will you call him
a dissolute man, and say he is none the worse?
He is a drunkard, and do you call it enjoyment?
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
He wastes for no good purpose, and do you look
upon him as enviable? What could a man do worse
than to be making his soul an ignominy? If a body
were to be distorted or maimed, you would think it
the saddest matter in the world; yet, contemplating
that man&rsquo;s soul wholly maimed, do you consider him
a happy man? &lsquo;But,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;he does not feel it.&rsquo;
And for this very reason he is the more to be pitied,
just as men who lose their wits are. For he who
knows that he is ill will seek the physician honestly
and apply remedies; whereas he who does not know
it will be beyond cure. Tell me, then, is this the
man you consider happy? But this is not astonishing,
for the majority of men are devoid of a right
estimate of things. So it is that, when chastised,
we pay the extreme penalty, and are not freed from
wrath; hence come desires and despondencies and
perpetual anxieties, since, when God shows us a
painless life, that of goodness, by removing ourselves
from it, we choose another road, the way of riches
and money, which is productive of a thousand evils.
We act as a man would act, who, not being able to
judge of physical beauty, but, ascribing everything
to clothes and adornment, should pass over a young
woman, possessing comeliness of body, and take to
himself an ugly one, deformed and crippled, merely
for her fine dress. The great mass of men now do
something of this kind in the matter of goodness and
badness, by following their bad nature on account of
its outward attraction, and by turning away from
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the good nature, which is blooming and beautiful, on
account of its unadorned comeliness, the very reason
why they should have chosen it.</p>

<h3 id="c19"><span class="sc">Whence the Rich?</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, xxxiv., vol. ii., p. 430.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>You ask, &lsquo;Whence come the rich?&rsquo; for it is
written, <i>Riches and poverty are from the Lord</i>. Now
let us ask those who urge this upon us, &lsquo;Then is all
wealth and all poverty from the Lord?&rsquo; Who would
say as much? For we see many laying up riches
for themselves through rapacity, through the spoliation
of tombs, through sorcery, and other means of the
same kind, and that those who possess these riches
are unworthy even of living. Now, tell me, is this
the wealth we recognise as from God? No, far
from it. Whence, then, does it come? From sin.
For a bad woman grows rich by misusing her body,
and the handsome youth often bartering the flower
of his years possesses his money in ignominy, and the
invader of graves who unearths tombs amasses the
wealth of unrighteousness, just as the thief does by
breaking down walls. Therefore not all wealth is
from God. How then, you ask, shall we answer
this argument? In the first place, understand that
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
poverty was not made by God either, and then we
will examine our argument. When a licentious
youth either spends his riches upon bad women, or
upon magical arts, or upon any other lusts of the
same nature, and thus becomes poor, is it not
evident that it is brought about not by God, but by
his own riotousness? Again, if a man were to
become poor through sloth, or to fall into poverty
because of his want of sense, or to engage in perilous
and unlawful pursuits, is it not evident once more
that no one of these or those like them would be
thrust into this want by God? Then, is the Scripture
false? God forbid, but those who lay down the law
on all the Scripture with insufficient discernment
are wanting in sense. For if it be asserted that the
Scripture is trustworthy, and it be proved that not
all wealth is from God, then the difficulty lies in the
weakness of those who put an inconsiderate construction
upon such things. I ought indeed to have
let you alone on this point, having first cleared the
Scripture of blame, in order to make you pay a
penalty for your carelessness concerning it; yet
since I have great pity on you, and cannot bear
to see you more troubled and confounded, let
me add the explanation, considering in the first
place who said it, then when it was said, and to
whom.</p>
<p>For God does not speak in the same way to all,
just as we ourselves do not use children as we use
men. Now, when is it said, and by whom, and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
whom? By Solomon of old to the Jews, who were
familiar with sensible things only, and measured
God&rsquo;s power by these. It is they who say, <i>Is He not
able to give us bread</i>? and, <i>What sign dost Thou show us?
Our fathers ate manna in the desert, whose belly is their
God</i>. Since they estimated Him by these things, he
tells them that God is also able to make men rich
and poor, not that He Himself does it altogether,
but that He can do it if He choose, as when He
says, <i>He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up, and bringeth
all the rivers to be a desert</i>, although this never
happened at all. How, then, does the prophet say
that it did? Not as really taking place, but implying
His power to do it. Now, what sort of
poverty does He give and what sort of wealth?
Call to mind the patriarch, and you will see what the
riches are which God bestows. For it was He Who
made Abraham rich, and Job after him, as Job
admitted in the words: <i>If we have received good things
from the Lord, shall we not endure the bad things as
well?</i> And later on their twofold increase was His
gift. And Jacob&rsquo;s riches began from the same
source. There is a poverty which is praised by Him,
that which He proposed to that rich young man,
saying, <i>If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and
give to the poor, and come and follow Me</i>; and again,
when legislating for the disciples, He said, <i>Ye shall
not possess gold nor silver nor two cloaks</i>. Therefore, do
not say that He gives wealth to all without exception,
for I have shown you that it is put together by
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
murders and covetousness and a thousand other like
causes.</p>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<h3 id="c20"><span class="sc">The Rich Young Man.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lxiii., vol. ii., p. 227.)</h3>
<p><i>And behold one came and said to Him: Good Master,
what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</i> Some
reject this young man as insidious and bad. I, however,
would not deny that he was a lover of money,
and unable to resist it, since Christ convicted him of
this; but I should not admit that he was insidious,
because it is not safe to make a venture upon what
is unknown, especially in accusations, and because
St. Mark has removed this doubt. For he says
<i>that running up and kneeling before</i> Him, he asked
Him a question, and again, that <i>Jesus, looking upon
him, loved him</i>. But great is the tyranny of money
as we gather from this; for even if we be quite faultless
as to other things, it alone spoils everything else.
St. Paul too justly called it the root of all evils.
<i>The love of money</i>, he says, <i>is the root of all evils</i>.
Now, why did Our Lord answer him by saying, <i>No
man is good</i>. Because the youth approached Him as
a mere man, as one of many, and a Jewish teacher:
on this account Our Lord spoke as man to man with
him. For He frequently answers according to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
secret mind of those who come to Him, as, for
instance, when He says, <i>We adore what we know</i>,
and, <i>If I bear witness to Myself, My witness is not true</i>.
When, then, He says, <i>No man is good</i>, He does not
say it to repudiate His own goodness&mdash;far from it; for
He does not say, &lsquo;Why do you call <i>Me</i> good? I am
not good,&rsquo; but, <i>No man is good</i>, that is, no man at all.</p>
<p>When He speaks in this way, He is not defrauding
men of all goodness, but making a distinction as to
God&rsquo;s goodness. So He added: <i>Only God is good</i>.
And He did not say, &lsquo;Only my Father,&rsquo; that you
may know that He did not disclose Himself to the
youth. Thus, higher up, He called all men bad,
saying, <i>But if you who are bad know how to give good
gifts to your children</i>. And if He called them wicked
in this place, He did not condemn human nature as
altogether bad (for He says <i>you</i>, not &lsquo;you, the
human race&rsquo;). He so called them, because He was
putting the goodness of man by the side of the
goodness of God, and therefore He added, <i>How much
more will your Father give good gifts to those who ask
Him</i>. And, you may say, what necessity or advantage
was there that He should answer the young
man in this way? He leads him up by degrees,
teaches him to put off all deception, withdraws him
from the things of earth, nailing him to God,
inducing him to seek the things to come, to know
the good, the root and foundation of all things, and
to refer honour back to Him. And thus when He
says, <i>You shall call no man master upon earth</i>, He
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
said it to make a distinction as to Himself, that they
might learn Who was the first Beginning of all
things. For, so far, the young man had shown no
slight willingness by rushing eagerly to embrace this
love; and whilst others had come, some to tempt,
others for the curing of disease, whether it was their
own or their neighbours&rsquo;, he had come and had
spoken for the sake of eternal life. The soil indeed
was rich and moist, but the brambles overpowered
and stifled the seed. For consider how far up to
this point he is disposed to obey commands. <i>What
shall I do</i>, he says, <i>that I may inherit eternal life?</i>
Thus ready was he to accomplish what he should be
told. But if he had come to Our Lord to tempt Him,
the Evangelist would have told us so, as he does in
other instances, and in that of the advocate. But if
the young man was silent, Christ would not have
allowed him to escape unknown, but would have
convicted him wisely, or have hinted at his meaning,
so that the youth should not think he had deceived
and escaped without recognition, and so have been
misled. If he had come to tempt, he would not
have gone away sad, because of what he heard.
This, at least, was not what any one of the Pharisees
of the day did; but when they were silenced, they
were angry. It was not so with the young man: <i>he</i>
went away cast-down, which was no small proof
that he had come with a weak rather than a bad
intention, with the desire of life, but weighed down
by another and a stronger passion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Therefore, when Our Lord said, <i>If thou wilt enter
into life, keep the commandments</i>, he asks, <i>Which commandments?</i>
This was not said tempting&mdash;far from
it&mdash;but thinking that he was to know of other commandments
besides those of the Law, which would
help him to life. This showed a great desire on his
part. Then, when Jesus enumerated those of the
Law, he said, <i>All these have I kept from my youth</i>.
And he did not stop his enquiry here, but asked
further, <i>What is yet wanting to me?</i> which in itself
was a proof of his eagerness. His thinking himself
to be still wanting in something, and his deeming
that the things already specified were not sufficient,
was no small step towards gaining what he desired.
What does Christ say? As He was about to accomplish
a great work, He put the prize before the
youth and said, <i>If thou wouldst be perfect, go, sell what
thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have a
treasure in heaven, and come and follow Me</i>. Do you
see what rewards and crowns He sets for this
career? If the young man had been tempting, he
would not have spoken these things to Him. But
now He does speak, and, as it were, draws him to
Himself, shows him the reward to be exceedingly
great, and unfolds the whole before his mind, hiding
throughout the semblance of irksomeness in the
advice. Therefore, before speaking of the combat
and the labour, He shows him the reward, saying,
<i>If thou wilt be perfect</i>; then He adds, <i>Go, sell what
thou hast and give to the poor, and</i>, again returning to
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
the rewards, <i>thou shalt have a treasure in heaven, and
come and follow Me</i>. For the following Him is a
great compensation. <i>And thou shalt have a treasure
in heaven.</i> Hence, as the matter turned on money,
and He was exhorting the young man to strip himself
of everything, He points out that He does not
take away possessions, but adds to them, and that
He gives more things than those of which He commanded
the sacrifice; and not merely are they more,
but they are as much greater as heaven is than
earth, and even more. He spoke of a treasure
which is double the thing given, showing it to be
abiding and secure, intimating thus through human
things what His listener was to understand. Indeed,
it is not enough to despise money, but a man
must also feed the poor and follow Christ above all
things; that is, he must carry out all His commandments,
hold himself in readiness to be slaughtered
and to suffer death any day. <i>If any man wish to
come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his
cross and follow Me.</i> As this command was a much
higher one than the giving up of money&mdash;even the
shedding of blood&mdash;so the giving up of money is no
slight help towards its fulfilment. And when the
young man had heard this word, <i>he went away sad</i>.
Then, as if to show that he had felt nothing
unreasonable, the Evangelist said, <i>for he was very
rich</i>. Those who possess a little and those who are
steeped in abundance are not equally restrained;
then it is that love becomes more tyrannical. So I
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
will not cease to say that the addition of superfluities
is fuel to the fire, that it makes their
possessors poorer, that it increases, indeed, their
desires, and makes them conscious of greater needs.
See how, in this case, passion showed its strength.
For when Our Lord commanded the man, who
came to him with joyful readiness, to renounce his
money, he was so cast down and perturbed as to go
away without giving any answer at all; and having
become silent and sad and gloomy, he thus departed.</p>

<h3 id="c21"><span class="sc">Different Kinds of Friendship.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lx., vol. ii., p. 199.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let us now consider the various forms which
friendship takes with the majority of men. One
man loves because he is loved; another because he
has been honoured; another shows a liking for a
man who has been of use to him in some practical
matter or other; another, again, for some such
similar reason; but it is difficult, indeed, to find a
man who loves his neighbour thoroughly and as he
ought for Christ&rsquo;s sake. For in most cases it is
temporal business which brings men together. St.
Paul did not love in this way: he loved for Christ&rsquo;s
sake, so that he loved others whether he was loved
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
by them or not, and did not break charity, since he
had laid a strong foundation for his love-charm. It
is not so now; indeed, if we search diligently, we
shall find in most men a fictitious friendship rather
than this. And if anyone gave me power to
enquire into the matter in so great a multitude, I
could show that the majority are bound to each
other for worldly reasons. This is apparent from the
causes which produce enmity. Since, then, men are
bound to each other for motives so paltry, there is
neither warmth nor fidelity in their mutual dealings;
but contempt, and money losses, and jealousy, the
love of honour, or any similar thing showing itself,
destroys the love-charm. It rests not upon a
spiritual foundation. If it were so, worldly things
would never break up spiritual things. The love,
indeed, which is born of Christ is strong and
enduring and invincible, and nothing has power to
dissolve it&mdash;neither calumnies, nor dangers, nor
death, nor any other of these things whatsoever. If
a man who thus loves should suffer in a thousand
ways, contemplating that on which love rests, he
stands unmoved. But the man who loves because
he is loved, if he should suffer some foolish thing or
other, breaks up his friendship, whilst the former is
firm to the end. This is why St. Paul said,
<i>Charity never falleth away</i>. What answer would
you make? That the man whom you have
honoured is a reviler? or that the one whom you
have benefited would wish to put you to death?
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
But if you love for Our Lord&rsquo;s sake, this encourages
you to love all the more. For those things which
are destructive to love in other cases become
productive of it in this particular one. How so?
In the first place, because the man so loved is the
cause of your reward; secondly, because one thus
situated requires special help and much care. On
this account a man who loves for Our Lord&rsquo;s sake
does not enquire about family, or country, or riches,
or demand love in return: he concerns himself
about none of these things, but even if he be hated,
or despised, or destroyed, he still loves, because his
affection is built on a strong foundation&mdash;Christ.
Hence he stands firm, steadfast, immutable, with
his eyes on Our Lord. So it was that Christ loved
His enemies&mdash;harsh men, scoffers, blasphemers,
haters, those who wished not even to see Him,
those who preferred stones and wood to His love, and
He loved them with the charity from above, in
comparison with which there is no other charity to
be found. <i>For</i>, He says, <i>no man hath greater charity
than this, that he giveth his life for his friends</i>. See
how loving He ceases not to be towards the very
men who crucified Him and reviled Him. He even
spoke for them to His Father, saying, <i>Forgive them,
for they know not what they do</i>. And, later on, He
charged His disciples with those same men. Let
us, then, be zealous for this same charity, and strive
to possess it, that, being made the imitators of
Christ, we may enjoy both present and future good
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
things by the grace and tenderness of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, to Whom be honour and glory for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="c22"><span class="sc">The Buyers and Sellers in the Temple.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lxvii., vol. ii., p. 277.)</h3>
<p><i>And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out
all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew
the tables of the money-changers, and the chairs of
them that sold doves. And He saith to them: It is written,
My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you
have made it a den of thieves.</i> John says the same
thing, but he says it in the beginning of his gospel,
whereas Matthew says it towards the end. Hence it
is evident that the thing recounted took place twice
and at different times. This is clear from the time and
from the answer. In St. Matthew it happened at
the very time of the Pasch; in St. John a good deal
before it. In the latter the Jews say, <i>What sign dost
Thou show us?</i> but in the former they are silent as if
rebuked, because He was an object of wonder to all
men. His doing the same action twice, and this in
an authoritative way, strengthens the charge against
the Jews, for they remained at their traffic, and
called Him God&rsquo;s enemy, when they should have
learnt from this His action how much He honoured
His Father and what His own power was. For He
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
was working wonders, and they saw a correspondence
between His words and His deeds. Still they were
unmoved and discontented, and this in the face of
the loud testimony of the Prophet and of children
witnessing to Him, with a wisdom beyond their
years. This is why He Himself uses as an arm
against them the accusing words of Isaias: <i>My house
shall be called the house of prayer</i>. He shows His
power not only in this way, but in the curing of
many kinds of diseases; for the lame and the blind
came to Him and He cured them, and He shows
forth His power and His authority. They, however,
were not persuaded in this way; but after
seeing these wonders, and listening to children
bearing witness to Him, they say, <i>Dost Thou not hear
what these say?</i> This was what Christ might have
said to <i>them</i>: &lsquo;Do you not hear what these say?&rsquo;
for they sang to Him as to God. What does He do?
Since they spoke against visible signs, He makes use
of a stronger correction, saying, <i>Have you never read,
Out of the mouths of infants and of sucklings Thou hast
perfected praise?</i> He said well, <i>out of the mouths</i>.
For that which they said did not come from themselves,
but from that power of His which controlled
the words of their tongues. This indeed was a type
amongst the nations of those who faltered and
cried out confusedly, speaking great things with discernment
and faith. Hence it was no small encouragement
to the Apostles also. In order that
they should not be perplexed as to how they, being
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
unlearned, are to announce the Gospel tidings, these
children by anticipation have cast out their fear,
because He who has caused the children to sing
will give them also reasoning powers. This was
not all that the wonder made manifest: it showed
Him to be the Lord of creation. These children of
unripe age, on the one hand, gave voice to words of
good omen which were in harmony with the things
above; but men, on the contrary, to outbursts of folly
and madness. Such was their badness. Whilst
then, they had many incitements to anger, the
attitude of the crowd, the throwing over of the
tables of the buyers, the voice of His wonders, that
of the children, He again leaves them, allowing their
passion to cool, and not wishing to begin His
teaching lest, boiling over with jealousy, they should
be still more angered at what had been said.</p>

<p>If twelve men leavened the whole world, consider
what <i>our</i> wickedness must be, inasmuch as we, being
so many, are unable to convert the remainder, when
we ought to suffice for the leavening of a thousand
worlds. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; some one says, &lsquo;they were apostles.&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
What does this matter? Had not they the same
surroundings as you? Were they not reared in
cities? Did they not lead the same sort of life?
Did they not follow a trade? Were they angels?
Did they come down from heaven? &lsquo;But,&rsquo; you say,
&lsquo;they worked wonders.&rsquo; It was not the wonders
which made them famous. How long shall we use
our own softness as a pretext for not considering
those wonders? For many who cast out devils,
since they afterwards worked iniquity, did not become
renowned, but were even chastised. And
what is it, you ask, which pointed them out as great?
The despising of money and of reputation, and the
withdrawal from worldly business. If they had
been without these things, and had been slaves to
their passions, even if they had raised up a thousand
dead men, not only they would have done no good,
but they would have been looked upon as deceivers.
Thus, it is the life in every case which is resplendent,
and which draws upon itself the unction of the
Spirit. Did not John work a sign when he made so
many cities hang upon his words? Yet listen to the
Evangelist saying that he worked no wonder: <i>John
did no wonder</i>. How did Elias become renowned?
Was it not by his outspokenness with the king&mdash;by
his zeal for God&rsquo;s service&mdash;by his possessing nothing&mdash;by
his sheep-skin, and his cavern, and his mountains?
For he worked his wonders after all these
things. What sign did the devil see Job doing
when he was struck with amazement? Not any at
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
all, but he found him leading a resplendent life,
which showed forth an endurance firmer than adamant.
What sign had David accomplished for God
to say of him, when still a youth, <i>I have found David,
the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart</i>? What dead
man did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob raise to life?
What leper did they cleanse? Do you not know
that, if we are not watchful, wonder-working is often
harmful? Thus it was that many of the Corinthians
fell into schism and many Romans lost their right
mind. Thus, too, that Simon was cast out, and
that the man who desired to follow Christ refused
the call when he heard that <i>foxes have holes, and birds
of the air have nests</i>. Each of these, the one seeking
money, and the other glory from the working of
signs, fell away and were lost. But purity of life
and the love of goodness not only do not produce
this desire, but they take it away where it exists.
And what did He Himself say when He was laying
down the law to His disciples? Did He say, &lsquo;You
shall do signs in order that men may see&rsquo;? Not at
all, but, rather, <i>Let your light shine before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
Who is in heaven</i>. Nor did He say to Peter, &lsquo;If thou
lovest Me, work wonders,&rsquo; but, <i>Feed My sheep</i>. And,
honouring Peter, with James and John, in every
instance more than the rest, how does He show this
honour, tell me? Is it in the doing of wonders?
No; for they all cleansed lepers, and raised the dead
to life, and to all He gave authority in equal measure.
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
How then were those three distinguished?
By interior virtue. Do you see that, everywhere,
life is the need, and the manifestation of works? <i>By
their fruits</i>, He said, <i>you shall know them</i>. What is it
which approves our life? Is it the manifestation of
wonders or an irreproachable conduct? Clearly it
is the latter; for the reason which calls forth signs
belongs to this world, and they cease in the next.
The man who gives an example of a good life draws
this charity upon himself; and he who shines by
charity shines in this way, in order that he may
correct the life of others. Since Christ also worked
those wonders in order that He might appear worthy
of confidence in this world, and, drawing men to
Himself, might introduce virtue into life; therefore,
more stress is laid upon this point. For He is not
contented with signs alone, but He threatens hell,
and He preaches the kingdom, and He enacts those
marvellous laws, and everything is done with a view
to His making men like to angels. But why do I
say that Christ does everything unto this end? Tell
me, if anyone gave <i>you</i> your choice either to raise up
the dead in His name or to die for His name&rsquo;s sake,
which would you choose? The latter surely; for
the one is a sign and the other is a deed. Again, if
anyone offered you the power of turning grass into
gold, or that of looking down upon all gold as if it
were grass, would you not rather choose the latter,
and with good reason? It would be this which
would attract men. For if they were to see food
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
turned into gold, and were even desirous of taking
the same power into their own hands, as Simon was,
the love of money would be increased in them; but
if they were to see all men looking down upon
money as upon grass, and making little of it, they
would be cured of this disease.</p>

world; and it is a reasonable light, far superior to
this physical light, just as spiritual salt is to material
salt. And first they are salt, and afterwards light,
in order that you may learn the force of strong
words and the advantage of this holy teaching. For
it is urgent and will not be diverted from its aim,
and, leading us by the hand, makes us look towards
goodness. <i>A city seated on a mountain cannot be
hidden. Neither do men light a candle and put it under
a bushel.</i> He leads them once more through these
things to purity of life, teaching them to be soldiers,
as if before the eyes of all men and wrestling in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
midst of the arena of the whole world. &lsquo;Look
not,&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;to rest now whilst you are in a
small corner; for you are to be visible to all men,
like a city seated on a mountain, and like a candle
shining upon all those in the house.&rsquo; Where, now,
are they who have distrusted the power of Christ?
Let them listen to these things, and, being frightened
by the might of the prophecy, let them fall down
and adore His almightiness. Think what great
things He promised to those who were not known
even in their native place: that they are to go over
land and sea, and to lift up their voice against the
temptations of the world, or rather not their voice,
but the force of their goodness. For it was not their
universal fame which made them conspicuous: it
was the manifestation of works. As if they had had
wings, they spread over the whole earth quicker
than light, sowing the light of piety. Hence, it
seems to me that He stimulates them unto fearlessness,
for His saying, <i>A city seated on the mountain
cannot be hidden</i>, was the manifestation of His own
power; for, if it were useless to hide that, so neither
could the Gospel tidings be hushed or concealed.
And to prevent them from thinking that persecutions,
and accusations, and plots, and wars, since He
spoke of these things, would have power to check
them, He encourages them by saying that not only
these persecutions will not pass unnoticed, but that
they will shine forth to the whole world, and that
through this very fact they themselves were to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
renowned and famous. In this, then, His own
power is manifested; but He furthermore requires
fortitude from each one of them, saying, <i>Men do not
light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a
candlestick, and it gives light to all in the house. So may
your light shine before men, that they may see your good
works and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.</i> &lsquo;For
it is I Who have enkindled the light,&rsquo; He says.
Whether, however, it remains lighted or not must
depend upon your zeal, not on your own account
alone, but for the sake of those who are to enjoy
this beacon, and whom it is to lead to the truth.
For the slanderings of men will not be able to veil
your brightness if you yourselves are leading strict
lives, and thus are preparing to convert the whole
world. Show forth, therefore, a life worthy of grace,
that, as the truth is preached everywhere, so your
life may harmonise with it. And, again, He holds
out another advantage besides the salvation of men,
which is capable of firing them with courage and
making all zealous. Not only will you reform the
world, He says, by living upright lives, but you will
also prepare the glory of God; just as by the contrary
course you destroy men, and cause the name
of God to be blasphemed. &lsquo;And how,&rsquo; you ask, &lsquo;is
God to be glorified through us if men are to slander
us?&rsquo; Not all men are to do this; but those who do
so hypocritically will wonder and admire you in
secret, just as outward flatterers of those who are
living in wickedness despise them in their own
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
minds. &lsquo;How, then, would you have us live for
show and vainglory? No, indeed, I said nothing
of the kind. I did not say, Make haste to bring
forth your good deeds before men; nor did I say,
Point them out; but, <i>Let your light shine</i>; that is,
let your virtue be solid, and the fire plentiful, and
the light undimmed.&rsquo; Whenever virtue is thus great,
it cannot possibly be hidden, even if he who pursues
it conceal it in a thousand ways. Show forth a
spotless life and let them have no real ground of
accusation, and then, even if accusers be numbered
by hundreds, no man shall have power to overcloud
you. And His expression, <i>the light</i>, was pertinent.
For nothing distinguishes a man so much, even if he
wish to be hidden a thousand times over, as an
example of goodness. Just as physical light envelops
a man, so does he shine forth with greater
brightness, not letting his rays sink into the earth,
but directing them beyond heaven itself. So He
encourages them the more. &lsquo;If,&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;you are
grieved at being reviled, many men through you will
be in admiration of God.&rsquo; He lays both wages to
your account&mdash;God&rsquo;s glorification through you, and
your being blasphemed for God&rsquo;s sake. In order,
therefore, that we should not give heed to evil
speaking, knowing that it procures us a reward, He
did not simply mention the thing itself, but made
two distinctions&mdash;that of calumny and that of
calumny for God&rsquo;s sake; and He shows, moreover,
that patience under it bears much fruit, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
referring the glory back to God; and He holds out
pleasant hopes to them. The accusation of the
wicked, He says, is in nothing so powerful as in
helping others to see your light. When you act
foolishly, then only it is that they will trample you
down, not when, doing what is right, you are cast
aside. Then many will be in astonishment, not at
you alone, but, through you, at our common Father.
He said the Father, not God, laying already the
seeds of the spiritual birth which He was to give
them. Then, showing His equality with the Father,
He said higher up, &lsquo;Grieve not for evil report; for
it is sufficient for you that it is on My account&rsquo;.
Thereupon He speaks of the Father, manifesting
their equality everywhere.</p>
<p>Recognising, therefore, our gain from this zeal
and the danger of our negligence (for it is much
worse that our Master should be blasphemed because
of us than that we should be lost), <i>Let us not
give offence to the Jews, or to heathens, or to the Church of
God</i>; and, showing forth a life more shining than
the sun, even if anyone should wish to accuse us,
not grieving at evil report, but at hearing a just
report unworthily. For if we are living in wickedness
and there be no accuser, we are the most
miserable of men, but if we are practising virtue,
even if the whole world should speak ill of us, we
shall be the most enviable of all, and we shall draw
all those who are called to be saved to ourselves;
for it is not by the accusation of the wicked but by
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
a good life that they will cleave to us. And a good
example speaks louder than any trumpet, and a pure
life is more resplendent than the very light, even if
there be a thousand adversaries. If we are all that
I have specified&mdash;if we are meek and humble and
merciful, and clean of heart and lovers of peace, and
when we are slandered do not repine but rejoice&mdash;we
shall draw those who look upon us to ourselves
no less than by signs, and every man will deal
kindly with us, whether he be a wild beast or a
demon, or anything else whatsoever. Still, if there
should be calumniators, do not be troubled at this,
nor at seeing yourself publicly accused, but examine
their inmost heart, and you will find that they
applaud and admire you, and are loud in your
praises. Just consider how Nabuchodonosor praised
the children in the furnace, although he was their
declared enemy; and when he saw their brave
endurance, he acclaimed and acknowledged them
for nothing else whatever than for turning away
from his commands to listen to those of God. For
when the devil sees that he is accomplishing nothing,
he desists, fearing lest he should be the means of
increasing our crowns; and when he is gone, however
bad and depraved a man may be, he recognises
virtue, that mist being removed from before his
eyes. And if men should form a wrong judgment,
you will have greater praise and admiration from
God. Therefore, be not sorrowful or wavering,
since the Apostles themselves were an odour of
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
death to some and of life to others. If you have
offered no offence to any man, and have kept free
from all reproach, you are blessed indeed. Shine,
then, by your life, and make no account of slandering
words. For it is quite impossible that a man
who cultivates goodness should not have many
enemies; but this is nothing to him, for through
these very enemies his life will shine the more.
Taking these things to heart, let us seek for one
thing&mdash;to order our own life with purity, for in this
way we shall lead those who sit in darkness to that
future life. Such, indeed, is the power of this light,
that it not only shines here, but it escorts those
who follow it to that heavenly country. Whenever
men see you looking down upon all present things,
and holding yourselves in readiness for eternal ones,
your works will convince them better than any
argument. Who so foolish as not to deduce a clear
proof of the future life when he sees a man, thinking
yesterday only of luxury and money-making, giving
up everything, freeing himself from all cares, and
stretching out his hand towards hunger, and poverty,
and hardship, and dangers, and blood-shedding, and
a violent death, towards everything which seems an
evil? But if we are wholly engrossed with present
things, and plunge into them deeper and deeper,
how are men to be persuaded that we are looking
for another home? What excuse shall we have if
the fear of God cannot do among us that which
human fame did amongst Greek philosophers?
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
Some of them also gave up money and despised
death, in order to be a spectacle to men, and so
their hopes were vain. What can be said for us
with these things before us, and so great a philosophy
being unfolded, that we cannot do even what
they did, but are destroying ourselves and others
too? For a heathen who acts against his conscience
does not do the same harm as a Christian who thus
acts, and most justly. Their reputation is corrupt,
whereas ours, through God&rsquo;s goodness, is sacred and
manifest even amongst impious men. Consequently,
whenever they want particularly to reproach us, and
to make their accusation more telling, they bring
this additional charge against us: &lsquo;So and so is a
Christian,&rsquo; which they would not do if they had not
a great opinion of Christian teaching. Have you
not heard how many and what great things Christ
enjoined? Now, how can you observe one of those
commandments when, forgetting the rest, you go
about investing your money, looking greedily after
interest, involving yourself in lawsuits, buying herds
of slaves, preparing silver plate, laying up stores of
fields and houses, and quantities of furniture? And
would that this were all! When you add iniquity
to these inopportune pursuits&mdash;encroaching upon
the land of others, pulling down houses, aggravating
poverty, increasing hunger&mdash;how will you be able to
mount up to those gates? But supposing that you
are merciful to the poor, I know what this means,
and it again will call for a great expiation hereafter.
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
For if you are merciful through conceit or vainglory,
so that you gain no merit even from good works,
what could be more wretched than to be shipwrecked
in harbour? In order to prevent this from
happening, seek not a reward from me when you
have done a good action, so that God may be your
debtor. <i>Lend</i>, He says, <i>to him from whom you expect
no return</i>.</p>

<h3 id="c25"><span class="sc">The Tongue a Royal Power.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, li., p. 76.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let us understand what those things are which
sully a man, and when we have understood let us
shun them. In the church we see a certain habit
prevailing amongst the majority of men&mdash;how they
are eager to come in with spotless clothes and clean
hands, whilst they do not trouble themselves about
how they are to offer up a pure heart to God. I say
this, not forbidding men to wash their hands or
their mouths; my wish, however, is that they
should wash them in the right way, not with water
alone, but rather with virtues. For slandering,
blasphemy, foul language, bad words, laughter at
low jokes, are the mouth&rsquo;s defilement. If, then, you
perceive that you are not dwelling on any of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
things, nor guilty of this uncleanness, approach
with good heart; if, on the contrary, you have laid
yourself open to these numerous stains, why are
you so foolish as to rinse your tongue with water
whilst you carry in it this pernicious and destructive
impurity? Tell me, now, if you had dirt or dung in
your hands, would you dare to utter a prayer?
Certainly not. Yet one is not at all harmful, and
the other is perdition. How comes it that you are
particular in things of no consequence, and negligent
about the prohibited ones? &lsquo;What, then,&rsquo;
you ask, &lsquo;are we not to go on praying?&rsquo;
Certainly you are, but not in this filthy condition,
nor with this dirt upon you. &lsquo;What am I to do,&rsquo;
you ask, &lsquo;if I fall by accident?&rsquo; Then, purify
yourself. How, and in what manner? Be in
mourning and groaning, give alms, apologise to the
man you have insulted, and reconcile him to yourself
by these things; purify your tongue in order
that you may incite the less the anger of God. For
if anyone with his hands full of mud were to grasp
your feet in supplication, not only would you not
listen to him, but you would kick him away; how,
then, are you so bold as to approach God in this
way? The tongue of those who pray is a hand, and
through it we touch the knees of
God.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> Therefore
do not defile that tongue, lest He should say to you,
<i>And when you multiply your prayer I will not hear</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
For, <i>in the hand of the tongue are life and death</i>;
and, again, <i>By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by
thy words thou shalt be condemned</i>. Therefore guard
the tongue more carefully than the pupil of the eye.
The tongue is the horse of a king. If you put a
bridle upon him and teach him to walk at a
measured pace, the king will rest and lean upon
him; but if you allow him to be at large unbridled,
and to be unmanageable, he becomes the vehicle of
the devil and his angels.... Dishonour not the
tongue, for how will it pray for you when it has lost
its proper confidence? Adorn it rather with mildness
and humility; make it worthy of the God
Whom you are invoking; fill it with words of kindness
and much almsgiving. For there is an alms
which is to be given by words: <i>The good word is better
than the gift</i>; and, again, <i>Answer the poor man in
mildness and gentleness</i>. And make the rest of your
time profitable by dwelling on the divine laws.<i> Let
all thy conversation be on the law of the Most High.</i>
Thus adorning ourselves, let us go forth to the King
and fall at His feet, not with the body only, but
with our mind. Let us consider Whom we go to,
for what purpose, and what it is we wish to accomplish.
We go to that God from Whom the
seraphim turned away their gaze, unable to bear His
splendour, on Whom the earth trembles to look.
We go to God, Who is in the region of light inaccessible.
And we are going to Him in order to escape
hell, for the remission of our sins, to deliver
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
ourselves from those overwhelming penalties, for the
winning of heaven and the goods which are there.</p>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<h3 id="c26"><span class="sc">Golden Vessels and Golden Hearts.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, l., p. 62.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let us then, too, touch the hem of His garment, or
rather, if we please, we have Himself whole and entire.
For His body too is now put before us, not His
garment only, but His very body, not to be merely
touched, but to be eaten and taken away. Let us
therefore approach with faith, each one with his own
infirmity. For if those who touched the hem of His
garment drew forth so much strength, how much
more those who possess the whole of Him? Approaching
with faith is not only taking what is there
before us, but touching with a pure heart, and being
so disposed as if we were going to meet Christ
Himself. What matters it if you hear no voice?
You see Him before you, or rather you <i>do</i> hear a
voice, that of Himself speaking through the Evangelists.
Believe, therefore, that even now there is
that banquet at which He Himself sat. Nor is this
banquet different from that; nor is ours the work of
a man, and that the work of God, but God is the
worker now as He was then. When, then, you see
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
the priest offering it to you, think that it is not
the priest who is doing this, but that it is the hand
of Christ which is presenting it. Just as, when he
baptises, it is not he who is baptising you, but it is
God Who is holding your head with an invisible
power, and neither angel nor archangel nor anyone
else whatsoever presumes to approach and touch
you; so it is now. For whenever God generates, it
is His gift alone. Do you not know how those who
adopt sons in this world do not entrust their adoption
to servants, but appear themselves in the court?
In like manner God has not entrusted His gift to
angels, but He is Himself present, commanding,
and saying, <i>You shall call no man your father upon
earth</i>, not wishing you to dishonour your natural
parents, but that before all the rest you may prefer
Him Who created you, and Who wrote your name
amongst His children. For He Who gives more,
that is, Who gives Himself, will all the more
certainly not disdain to make over His body to you.
Let us then, both priests and laity, consider what
that is of which we have been made worthy; let us
consider and be in awe. He gave us to be filled
with His sacred flesh, and placed before us Himself
offered up in sacrifice. Now, what will our excuse
be, if feeding on such food we commit such sins;
when we eat the Lamb and are become wolves; when
we eat the sheep and ravage like lions? For this
mystery obliges us to purify ourselves not only from
robbery but from the merest enmity. This mystery
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
is indeed a mystery of peace; it cannot be conciliated
with a struggle for money. For if He did
not spare Himself for our sakes, what should we
deserve for hoarding up money and neglecting our
soul, on which account He did not spare <i>Himself</i>?
God indeed bound the Jews to a remembrance of
their domestic blessings every year at the feasts, but
you He has bound to a daily remembrance, so to
say, through these mysteries. Be not, then, ashamed
of the cross, for these are our august things, these are
<i>our</i> mysteries, we are adorned with this gift, and it
is our beauty. Even when I say that He stretched
the firmament overhead, and unfolded earth and
sea, that He sent forth prophets and angels, I speak
of nothing equal to this. This is the fountain-head
of all good, that He did not spare His only Son in
order to save alienated servants. Therefore, let
neither Judas nor Simon approach this table, for
avarice destroyed both one and the other. Let us
avoid this abyss, and think not that it is sufficient
for our salvation, if, after stripping widows and
orphans, we offer a cup of gold and precious stones
for this table. If you wish to show honour to the
sacrifice, offer your soul for whose sake it was
sacrificed. Make this golden, for if <i>it</i> should be
inferior to lead and potsherd, what is the gain of the
vessel being of gold? Then, do not let us be
concerned only about how we are to offer a vessel
of gold, but let it be also a vessel of honest labours,
for that which is without avarice is more precious
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
than gold. The church is neither a gold nor a
silver-smith&rsquo;s shop, but an assembly of angels, therefore
souls are what we want, and these things are
acceptable to God through souls. The table which
He then used was not of silver, nor was the chalice
a golden one out of which Christ gave His own blood
to His disciples; but all those things were sacred
and terrible, since He filled them with the Spirit.
Would you honour the body of Christ? Leave
Him not naked, nor honour Him <i>there</i> with silk
coverings, passing Him by outside in cold and
nakedness. He who said, <i>This is My body</i>, ratifying
the deed by His word, said likewise, <i>You saw Me in
want and did not feed Me</i>, and, again, <i>Inasmuch as
you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did it
not for Me</i>. For the former does not require the
giving of garments but a pure heart, whereas the
latter demands great attention. Let us, then, learn
to be wise and to honour Christ as He Himself
wishes, for to Him Who is honoured, that honour
is the sweetest which He chooses for Himself, not
that which may be according to our judgment.
Since Peter, too, thought to honour Him by forbidding
Him to wash his feet, he was not showing
honour, but the reverse. So in your case do you
honour Him with the honour which He Himself
laid down, by giving your riches to the poor. God
has no need of golden vessels, but of golden hearts.</p>

<h3 id="c27"><span class="sc">True Almsgiving.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Paul&rsquo;s Second Epistle to the Corinthians</i>, xvi., vol. iii., p. 182.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Charity is, indeed, a great thing, and a gift of
God, and when it is rightly ordered, likens us to
God Himself as far as that is possible; for it is
charity which makes the man. Some one, at least,
wishing to characterise man, did it in these words:
<i>Man is great, and the merciful man is honourable</i>.
Kindness is better than raising up the dead. For it
is a much greater thing to feed Christ in His hunger
than to raise the dead in the name of Jesus. By
feeding Christ you confer a benefit upon Him; in
the other case He is benefiting you. And the
reward is for doing, not for receiving. As to the
signs, you are under an obligation to God, but with
regard to the almsgiving, you put God under an
obligation to you. It is an alms when you give
willingly, generously, thinking that you are rather
taking than giving; when you give as if you were
receiving something, as gaining rather than losing,
otherwise there would be no thanks in it. He who
helps his neighbour should be in gladness, not in
gloom. In truth, is it not foolish that in removing
the despondency of another you yourself should be
despondent? You will not suffer it to be a real
alms. If you are sad because you are taking away
another man&rsquo;s sadness, you are giving a proof of
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
extreme unkindness and inhumanity; it is better to
leave it undone than to do it in this way. Why are
you sad at all? Is it for fear of diminishing your
money? If this is your motive, then do not give;
if you are not encouraged by the thought that it will
be made up to you over and above in heaven, do not
put out your hand in alms-giving. Perhaps you
look for a compensation in this world. What is the
good of this? Let your alms be alms and not traffic.
Now, many have received their due here on earth,
yet not so that they will be on this account much
better than those who have not; these have been a
few of the weaker, since they did not go vigorously
after the things above. And like greedy and
common people, slaves of their belly, who, called to
a royal table, and not waiting for the right time, do
as children do, spoil their own mirth by snatching
up and satiating themselves with inferior food: so,
indeed, is it that they who seek and receive temporal
good things lessen the reward above. Again, in
lending your money, you become desirous of
securing the capital after a time, or, perhaps, of not
spending it, so that you may lay up more for the
future, whereas in this case you demand it at once,
although you are not always to be here, but for ever
there. Nor are you to be judged here, but to give
an account there. Supposing that a man prepared
houses for you where you did not mean to stay, you
would view his act as a penalty; and would you wish
to grow rich in a place from which you may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
called away before the evening? Know you not
that we are spending our time in a foreign land,
like sojourners and strangers, and that sojourners
may be cast out when they are not thinking of it or
expecting it. And this is our case. So it is that we
leave behind us whatever we may have busied ourselves
with on earth. Our Master does not allow us
to take our labours with us, whether it is that we
build houses, or buy estates, or slaves, or furniture,
or anything else of the kind. Not only He does not
allow us to go away with them, but He refuses you
a reward for them. He told you beforehand that
you should not build or spend with the property of
others, but with your own. Why, then, leaving
your own, do you labour with what is not yours,
and squander it so that you will lose both your
labour and your reward, and endure the extremity
of punishment? Do not so act, I beseech you; but,
as we are sojourners by nature, let us become so by
choice, so that we may not be aliens there, rejected
without honour. If we wish to be citizens in this
world we shall be so neither here nor there, but if
we remain sojourners, and spend our time after the
fashion of sojourners, we shall receive the assurance
of being citizens both here and there. For the just
man, even with nothing, will be as free on earth
with the common property of all as if it were his
own, and when he departs hence to heaven he will
look upon the eternal dwelling-places; he will
neither suffer any unpleasantness in this world, nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
will any man be able to make him a sojourner, who
has the whole world for his city; and in taking
possession of his country, he will, moreover, receive
true riches. In order, then, that we may gain both
the things of time and the things of eternity, let us
use present goods in the right way. Thus we shall
become citizens of heaven, and enjoy much consolation.
May this be the portion of us all, through the
love and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom,
with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory and
power for ever. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Are you unable to practise the virginal life?
Then make a prudent marriage. Are you unable to
do without possessions? Give, then, of what you
possess. Is such a burden too heavy for you?
Divide your goods with Christ. Are you not willing
to cede Him everything? Make over to Him at
least the half or the third part. He is your brother
and co-heir; make Him your co-heir even on earth.
How much soever you give to Him you give that to
yourself. Do you not listen to the Prophet&rsquo;s words,
<i>Despise not thy own flesh</i>? But if we may not despise
relations, how much less the Master, Who, besides
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
His superiority, has the rights of relationship on His
side, and many other stronger claims? He has
made you a partaker of His own possessions, taking
nothing from you, but being the first to give to you
out of His unspeakable mercy. Then, is not it
extreme folly neither to grow kind by this gift, nor
to return a reward for a favour, and to give less
instead of more? For He has made you heir to the
kingdom of heaven, but you have not even given
Him a share of the things of earth. You He reconciled
without any merit of your own, when you were
even His enemy; will you not make any return to
your lover and benefactor, although, over and above
the kingdom and all His other gifts, it was just that
you should feel grateful to Him for the giving itself?
Servants, indeed, when they call their masters to
dinner, deem not that they are offering, but receiving;
here, however, it was just the contrary. It
was not the servant who first called the Lord, but
the Lord Who first called the servant to His own
table; and will you not call Him even after this?
He was the first to bring you under His own roof;
can you not even follow His example? He covered
you in your nakedness, and in the face of this do
you refuse to bring in a stranger? It was He Who
first gave you to drink of His own cup, and will you
not offer Him even cold water? He gave you the
Holy Spirit to drink, and will you not relieve bodily
thirst? He gave you the Spirit to drink, who were
worthy of chastisement, but do you disregard a
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
thirsty man whilst you are about to do all this out
of what is His? Do you not consider it a great
honour to hold the cup out of which Christ is about
to drink, and to approach it to His mouth? Do you
not see that the priest alone may give the chalice
with the Blood? &lsquo;I go into none of these particulars.&rsquo;
Our Lord says: &lsquo;If you yourself give it I receive it;
even if you are a layman I do not refuse it. I do
not require what I have given, for I seek not blood
but cold water.&rsquo; Consider, then, <i>Whose</i> thirst you are
relieving, and be in awe. Consider that <i>you</i> have
become Christ&rsquo;s priest, giving with your own hands
not flesh but bread, not blood but a drink of cold
water. He has put on you the robe of salvation,
and has clothed you through Himself; do you also
clothe <i>Him</i> in the person of a child. He has made
you a name in heaven; do you drive away cold,
and nakedness, and unseemliness. He has made you
a citizen of the angels; if you can bear it, give Him
a portion only, give Him house-room as you would
your servant. He says, &lsquo;I will not turn away from
this refuge, and that when I have opened all heaven
to you. I have delivered you,&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;from the
bitterest captivity: <i>I</i> do not require this, nor do I
say, Deliver Me; but if you only see Me in chains,
this is sufficient to console Me. I raised you from
the dead: this I do not require from you; but I say,
only visit Me when I am sick.&rsquo; Since, then, the gifts
given to us are thus great, and the things demanded
of us so very small, and we do not offer even these,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
what sort of hell should we not deserve? It is just
that we should go down into the fire which was prepared
for the devil and his angels, since we are
harder than a rock. For, tell me, what insensibility
is this, receiving gifts so great with the prospect of
the same hereafter, to be the slaves of money, which
in a little while we shall have to give up, and to give
up unwillingly? Others have laid down their lives
and shed their blood, but you have not hazarded the
smallest thing for heaven or for those unfading
crowns. What sort of excuse or pardon would you
deserve for enjoying all things with the fat of the
earth, neglecting nothing for putting your money
out to interest, and yet being cruel and inhuman in
feeding your Lord in the person of the indigent?
Pondering all this in our minds, and considering
what we have received, and what we are going to
receive, and what we are asking for, let us show
forth all our zeal in spiritual things. Let us, then,
become gentle and kind, so that we may escape the
weight of that tremendous judgment. What is
there which is not sufficient to condemn us?&mdash;the
enjoyment of things so wonderful, the being asked
for nothing great, the fact that we shall have to
give up what we are asked for in spite of ourselves
when we leave this world, the ostentation of great
ambition in worldly things. Each one of these is
by itself sufficient to condemn us, but when they
are all combined, what hope will there be of
salvation? In order, then, that we may escape
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
this great condemnation, let us show ourselves
kind towards the poor.</p>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<h3 id="c29"><span class="sc">The Archetype and the Type.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on the Epistle to the Philippians</i>, xiii., vol. v., p. 136.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>The Apostles presented a type, maintaining in their
own persons a certain archetype. Consider how
austere their life was, as if offering an archetype, and
example, and living laws. For they set forth to all,
through their deeds, that which the Scripture said.
This is the best teaching, which has power to lead
the disciple. You may talk and use fine words, but
if your actions do the contrary you are no teacher.
The disciple thinks very little of fine words; they
should be accompanied by the teaching and leading
of works: this makes both the master venerable, and
disposes the disciple to agree with him. How so?
When he hears a man making a display of words, he
says that he has enjoined what is impossible, and
that he who is not a doer is the first to prove their
impracticability. Now, if he saw a man practising
goodness in deed, he would not be able to say this.
Moreover, supposing the master&rsquo;s life be careless, let
us rouse ourselves, and listen to the Prophet, saying,
<i>All shall be taught by God</i>, and again, <i>They shall teach</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
<i>no more every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord;
for all shall know Me, from the least of them even to the
greatest</i>. Have you no righteous teacher? You have
the real Master, Him Whom alone you may call
Master, learn of Him. <i>He</i> said, <i>Learn of Me, for I am
meek</i>. Cleave, then, to no teacher, but to Him and
to His teaching. Take your model from Him; you
have a most excellent one; fashion yourself after it.
The Scripture offers us numberless examples of a
holy life; choose which you will, and follow the
Master with His disciples. One shone by poverty,
another through riches; for instance, Elias by
poverty, Abraham by his wealth; choose whichever
you think the easier and securer. Again, the one
was holy through marriage, the other through
virginity, as Abraham and Elias: choose your road,
for each leads to heaven. John was holy by fasting,
and Job without it. Job, moreover, was what he
was by despising wife, and sons, and daughters, and
house, having great wealth, whilst John possessed
nothing except his sheep-skin. And why do I speak
of house and abundance and money, since a king
has it in his power to win goodness for himself. A
royal palace would be found to be far more troublesome
than any private house. David, then, shone in
his royalty, and his purple and his crown impeded
him in nothing: another was entrusted with the
leadership of a whole people&mdash;I mean Moses&mdash;which
is a more difficult thing. In the latter, power was
greater, therefore the difficulty was greater. Do
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
you see men who gained a good name both in riches
and in poverty, in marriage and in continency?
Now look, on the other hand, at those who were
lost both in marriage and in continency, in riches
and in poverty. For instance, many men, living in
the married state, have been lost, like Samson, not
because of marriage, but through their own will; in
virginity, too, as the five virgins; in abundance, as
the rich man who despised Lazarus; in poverty, for
thousands of poor are lost every day. I can show
you many men lost in monarchy, many in leading
the people. Would you like to know of some in
armies who have been saved? There is Cornelius.
And of some in stewardships? There is the eunuch
of the Ethiopian. Thus, if everywhere we use
wealth as we should, it does us no harm; if we do
not, everything harms us&mdash;royalty and poverty and
riches. Nothing can hurt the man who is watching.
Tell me, has captivity ever harmed anyone? No,
never. Think of Joseph in servitude, bearing goodness
in his mind; think of Daniel and the three
children taken captive, how they shone the more.
Everywhere goodness is resplendent and invulnerable,
and nothing can master it. Why do I speak of
poverty and captivity and slavery? I may add
hunger and ulceration and a painful illness, for this
is worse than slavery. Lazarus suffered this, and
Job, and Timothy with his frequent infirmities. Do
you see how nothing can overcome goodness?
Neither wealth, nor poverty, nor power, nor leadership,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
nor being at the head of affairs, nor illness, nor
being unknown, nor cast aside: disregarding all
these things on the earth, it makes its way to heaven.
Only have a brave spirit, and there is no obstacle
against goodness. When the labourer is strong, no
external thing hinders him. And so, in the case of
handicrafts, when a mechanic is experienced and
steadfast, and possesses all his art, even if illness
should come, he has it still; or if he should be in
poverty, he has it; and whether he has the instrument
in his hands or not, whether he works or not,
it is not diminished, because the science is in himself.
So is it with God&rsquo;s servant: even if you throw
him into riches, his art is shown forth; or into
poverty, or disease, or health, or contempt, or fame, it
is all the same. Did not the Apostles work through
everything? <i>Through honour and dishonour, and evil
report and good report.</i> This shows the soldier, the
being invulnerable against everything. For this is
the nature of virtue. If you say, &lsquo;I am unable to be
set over many, I do best alone,&rsquo; you insult virtue,
for it can benefit all, and show itself, let it only be
in the mind. Has hunger to be endured? or is
there abundance? Virtue, again, shows its own
strength; as Paul said: <i>I know both how to be brought
low, and I know how to abound</i>. Was it necessary to
work? He was not ashamed, but laboured for two
years. Was hunger to be borne? He neither pined
nor doubted. Had he to die? He did not lose
heart, but showed in all things a brave soul and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
skill. Now let us emulate him, and we shall have
no cause for sorrow. For, tell me, what is capable
of grieving such a man? Nothing. As long as no
one robs us of virtue, the man who possesses it is
the happiest of creatures even here&mdash;not only there.
Supposing there is a holy man, with wife and
children, and money, and a great name, and he
still remains holy in spite of them: take them
away, and he will still be holy: neither dejected by
tribulation, nor elated by his righteousness, but like
a rock which stands immovable whether the sea
rages or whether it is calm, not troubled by the
waves nor affected by the calm, so does the steadfast
soul stand bravely both with calm, and with
foaming waves. And, as children sailing on the
sea are frightened whilst the pilot sits still and
laughs at them, sees their trouble and is of good
cheer, so does the mortified soul recline as if on
some land or oasis of contentment, whilst all men
are troubled, and laughing in an untimely way at
the vicissitudes of things. For what can disturb
the soul of a peaceful man? Death? But this is
the beginning of a better life. Or poverty? This
helps that soul on to virtue. Or illness? It
accounts both refreshment and suffering as nothing,
for it punished itself beforehand. Or being defamed?
But the world is crucified to it. Or the
loss of children? It had no fear if fully convinced
of the resurrection. What, then, can make it
miserable? Nothing whatever. If this man be
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
rich, is he puffed up? By no means, for he knows
that money is nothing. What of fame, then? He
has been taught that <i>all human glory is like the flower
of the field</i>. Or luxury, again? He has listened to
Paul&rsquo;s words: <i>She that liveth in pleasure is dead while
she is living</i>. Now, since this soul is neither lifted
up nor dejected, what could come up to this well-being?
Not all souls are so disposed, but they are
more changeable than wind or weather, so that it
is most ludicrous to see the same man now laughing,
now weeping, now buried in thought, now loquacious
beyond measure. Therefore he said: <i>Be not
conformed to this world</i>: our citizenship is in heaven,
where there is no change. Immutable rewards are
offered to us: let us show forth that citizenship
whence we have already received good things. But
what if we cast ourselves into uncertainty and a
surging sea, into a storm or a hurricane? Let us
be at peace. The point lies not in riches or poverty,
or glory or dishonour, or sickness or health, or
weakness, but in our own soul. If this be steadfast
and well-grounded in goodness, all things will be
easy to it, and even here it will behold its rest, and
the peaceful harbour, and departing hence it will
gain endless goods. May it be granted to us all
through the love and kindness of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, to Whom, with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, be glory, power, and praise now and for ever.
Amen.</p>

<h3 id="c30"><span class="sc">The Weak Things of God.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, vi., vol. ii., p. 59.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and
in much trembling.</i> Here, again, is another point.
Not only are those who believe illiterate, not only
is the teacher illiterate, not only is the mode of
teaching replete with illiterateness, not only is the
teaching itself qualified to terrify&mdash;for it was the
Cross and death&mdash;but together with these there
were other obstacles: dangers and plottings, and
daily anguish, and harassing pursuit. For he often
calls persecution weakness, as he does in another
place: <i>Ye have not spurned the weakness in my flesh</i>;
and again: <i>If it behoves me to glory, I will glory in
my weakness</i>. What weaknesses are these? <i>The
governor of king Areta was keeping the city of Damascus,
wishing to take me.</i> And again: <i>Therefore I rejoice in
my infirmities</i>. Then, going on to distinguish what
infirmities, he added: <i>In contumely, in want, in persecutions</i>.
So here he speaks in the same way; for,
saying, <i>And I was in weakness</i>, he added, <i>and I was
with you in fear and in much trembling</i>. What is
this? Did Paul himself fear dangers? He did
indeed, and greatly too; for, if he was Paul, he was
also a man. This is no accusation against Paul,
but a weakness of nature, and an encomium of his
choice, that whereas he <i>did</i> fear stripes and death,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
this fear did not lead him to do any unworthy
action; so that those who say he did <i>not</i> fear stripes
not only do not exalt him, but take much away from
his praises. If, indeed, he did <i>not</i> fear, where is the
fortitude and where is the merit of braving dangers?
For my own part, this is what I admire in him,
that, fearful as he was, and not only fearful, but
trembling at dangers, he came out victorious through
everything, and in no case surrendered, cleansing
the world, and sowing the Gospel all over the earth
and sea. <i>And my speech and my preaching was not in
the persuasive words of human wisdom</i>&mdash;that is, it has
not outward wisdom. If, therefore, his preaching
had no subtlety about it, and those who were called
were uncultured as well as the preacher, and there
was, besides, persecution, and fear, and trembling,
tell me, how did they gain the mastery without
divine power? So, in saying, <i>That which I say and
preach does not consist in the persuasive words of wisdom</i>,
he added, <i>but in the manifestation of the Spirit and of
power</i>. Do you see how the folly of God is wiser
than man, and how the weakness is stronger?
Illiterate as they were who preached these things,
in chains and imprisoned, they overcame those who
bound them. How? Was it not through showing
the faith which is of the Spirit? This, indeed, was
an irrefutable argument. For, tell me, what man,
seeing the dead arise and devils put forth, would not
have received their teaching? Since, however, there
are powers of deception, such as those of magicians,
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
he removed this ambiguity. He did not speak of
power only, but first of the Spirit and then of
power, thus showing that what had taken place
was spiritual. Consequently, there having been no
learning about the preaching of the Gospel is no
lessening of its value, but its greatest glory. This,
at least, shows it to be divine, and to have had its
root above, in heaven. On this account he continued:
<i>That your faith may not be in the wisdom of
man, but in the power of God</i>. Do you see how
clearly in everything he pointed out the gain of
illiterateness and the harm of culture? While
human wisdom made the Cross vain, ignorance
proclaimed the power of God: the one disposed
men not to find the necessaries of life, and so to
glory in themselves; the other, to receive the truth
and to glory in God. Again, wisdom persuaded
many men to regard dogma suspiciously as human;
ignorance pointed it out clearly as divine, and
coming down from heaven. Now, whenever a
proof is arrived at by word-wisdom, it is very often
the bad men who get the better of the more moderate,
being the more skilful in their arguments, and
falsehood outwits the truth. It is not so here: for
neither does the Holy Spirit take possession of an
unclean soul, nor when He has taken possession
can He be ever lessened, even if all the clever words
in the world be used. A manifestation through
works and signs is much clearer than that of words.</p>
<p>But some one might reasonably say that, if the
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
Gospel is bound to conquer, and the Cross needs no
eloquence, that it may not be proved vain, why is
it that miracles have now ceased? Why is it? Do
you speak as an unbeliever, and not receive those
which took place in the case of the Apostles, or do
you honestly seek to learn? If as an unbeliever,
then I will first direct myself to this. Now, if
miracles did <i>not</i> take place then, how did they make
themselves heard, standing up against whole peoples
and speaking such things, driven about as they
were, pursued, in fear, in chains; one and all
an object of hatred to the world; at the mercy of
everyone&rsquo;s ill-treatment; having nothing attractive
of their own&mdash;neither eloquence, nor fame, nor riches,
nor city, nor nationality, nor family, nor career, nor
reputation, nor any one of these things, but just
the reverse of them all, an illiterate and sorry
condition, poverty, hatred, and enmity? Their injunctions
also entailed much hardship and their
teaching many dangers, and the hearers too who
were to be persuaded were given up to much feasting
and drunkenness and vice. Now, tell me, whence
their power of persuasion, whence their titles of
credence? As I was saying, if they <i>did</i> gain men
without miracles, the wonder appears very much
greater. Therefore do not conclude that because
there are no miracles now there were none then.
It was to the point, both that they took place then
and that they do not take place now. Persuasion
by word alone now is no security that the Gospel
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
lies in the possession of wisdom. For they who in
the beginning were sowers of the Word were uncultured
and ignorant, and they spoke nothing of
themselves, but they gave to the world that which
they had received from God; now, we also spread
abroad not our own inventions, but we speak to all
what we have received from them. We do not
persuade by arguments now but by Holy Scripture,
and the signs which then took place inspire us with
confidence in what we say. Neither did they persuade
by signs alone, but also by discoursing, whilst
the signs made their words appear the more powerful
together with the testimony of the Old Testament,
not the cleverness of what was said. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; you ask,
&lsquo;were miracles good then and not now?&rsquo; Let us
suppose a case, for so far my contest has been
directed against a heathen, and therefore I will
suppose something that must undoubtedly happen;
let us then suppose a case, and let the unbeliever
submit to believe, for instance, that Christ will come,
even if he take my word for it; well, then, when
Christ shall come and all the angels with Him, and
He is shown to be God, and all things are under His
dominion, will not the heathen too believe? It is
evident that he will fall down in adoration and
confess Him to be God, however stubborn he may
be. Who, indeed, seeing the heavens opened and
Christ Himself seated on the clouds, with all the
heavenly host surrounding Him, the rivers running
fire, all men standing by in great fear, would not
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
worship Him and acknowledge Him as God? Tell
me now, shall that worship and knowledge be accounted
to the heathen as faith? By no means.
For it is <i>not</i> faith; sheer force produces it, and the
manifestation of visible things. It is not a matter
of choice, but reason is constrained by the greatness
of the vision. Therefore, the more evident and undeniable
that which happens is, by so much is faith
diminished, and this is why miracles are not worked
now. And that it is so, listen to Our Lord&rsquo;s words
to St. Thomas: <i>Blessed are they who have not seen yet
have believed</i>. Therefore the reward of faith is diminished
just in proportion to the greater evidence of
the sign, so that if signs took place now the same
would follow. In the words, <i>Now we walk through
faith, not through sight</i>, Paul made it clear that then
we shall no longer know Him by faith. Thus, if you
believe then, you will not be convinced by the
wonder of the thing, so neither would you be now if
the same signs took place as of old. Whenever we
receive things which are in no sort of way discoverable
to anyone by reasoning, that is faith. On this
account, too, hell is threatened, but is not apparent,
for if it were, the same would be the case here also.
Still, if you seek for miracles, you will see them even
now, though they are not the same kind of miracles.
You will see a thousand prophecies concerning a
thousand things, the conversion of the world, the
holy life of barbarians, the change of cruel habits,
the increase of piety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&lsquo;What prophecies are these?&rsquo; you ask. &lsquo;For all
that was foretold was written down after the event.&rsquo;
Tell me when, and where, and by whom, and how
long ago? Shall we say it was fifty years ago or
a hundred? Therefore a hundred years ago there
was nothing at all written down. Then how did the
world receive the teaching and all other things, as
memory did not suffice? How did they know that
Peter was crucified? How after this did it occur to
men to foretell such things, for instance, as that the
Gospel should be preached in the whole world, that
the Jewish dispensation should stop and not come
back again? How would those who had staked their
lives for the Gospel have borne to see it counterfeited?
How were the writers trusted when there
were no more miracles? How did those writings
penetrate into uncivilised lands, and into India, and
even unto the farthest extremities of the ocean, if the
speakers were not worthy of faith? Now, who were
the writers? When and where did they write?
Why did they write? Was it to make themselves
famous? Why did they ascribe the Scriptures to
others? Were they desirous of embodying a system
of doctrine? Then was it true or false? For if they
looked upon it as false, there was no pretext for their
coming forward at all; but if as true, there was no
need of counterfeits, as you truly say. Moreover,
the prophecies are such that up to the present day
what has been said cannot be restricted by time.
If, on the one hand, the destruction of Jerusalem
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
took place many years ago, there are other
prophecies dating from the same time which reach
up to His coming. Examine these, if you like&mdash;as,
for instance, <i>I am with you always, even unto the
consummation of time</i>, and, <i>Upon this rock I will build
My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it</i>; again, <i>This Gospel shall be preached to all nations</i>,
and the deed of the woman who was a sinner, and
many more than these. Now, whence comes the
truth of this prophecy if it was an invention? How
have the gates of hell not prevailed against the
Church? How is Christ always with us? If He
were not with us, the Church would not have
conquered. How has the Gospel been spread about
the whole world? Our adversaries are able to bear
witness to the antiquity of our Scriptures&mdash;I mean
Celsus and his party, and the man of Batavia after
him&mdash;for they did not contradict what those who
came after them put together; moreover, the whole
world with one voice has received it. For if it was
not the grace of the Spirit, there could not have
been so great an unity from end to end of the earth,
but the inventors would speedily have been convicted,
nor would successes so great have been
produced by forgeries and falsehood. Do you not
see the whole world coming to meet it, and error
extinguished?&mdash;the mortification of monks shining
brighter than the sun? Do you not see bands of
virgins, the piety of barbarians, men all serving
under one yoke? Nor are these things foretold by
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
us alone, but first by the prophets. You must not
overlook those prophecies of theirs either, for our
Scriptures are present to our enemies, and Greeks
have set themselves eagerly to translate them into
the language of Greece. These prophecies foretell
many things, and show that He Who was to come is
God.</p>
<p>Now, why do not all men now believe? Because
things have been going to the bad, and it is we who
are the cause of it. The rest of my discourse is for
your benefit. It was not, indeed, through signs only
that they then believed, but many were led on by an
example of life. <i>Let your light shine before men</i>, Our
Lord says, <i>that they may see your good works and glorify
your Father Who is in heaven</i>. And, again, <i>They all
had one heart and one mind, and no man among them
called anything his own, but they had all things in
common, and to each man was given according to his
need</i>, and their life was an angelical one. And if
this were to take place now, we should convert the
whole world even without wonder-working. In the
meantime, let those who wish to be saved follow the
Scriptures: there they will find both these successes
and many more besides. For the teachers themselves
surpassed those deeds, living their lives in
hunger and thirst and nakedness; we, on the
contrary, wish to enjoy much feasting, and refreshment,
and security. Not so those men who cried
out: <i>Up to the present hour we are in hunger and thirst
and nakedness, and are homeless and beaten about</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Some went out from Jerusalem as far as Illyria, one
to the Indies, one to the Moors, another to all parts
of the earth; we, on the other hand, have not
courage to leave even our own country, but seek for
luxury, and splendid households, and abundance of
every kind. Which of us ever suffered hunger for
God&rsquo;s Word, or went into the desert, or took a long
journey for it? What teacher living by his hands
has come to the help of others? Who has encountered
death day after day? Hence our people
are growing softer. For if anyone were to see
soldiers and generals wrestling with hunger and
thirst, and death, and every possible evil, and
bearing cold and dangers with the fortitude of lions,
and conquering; and if, after this, he were to see
them giving up their life of heroism, becoming faint-hearted,
loving money, absorbed in their own affairs
and business, and then defeated by their enemies, it
would be extreme folly to seek for the reason. Let
us apply this to ourselves and our forefathers, for we
have grown weaker than anyone else, and we are
nailed to this present life. Even if a man be found
with a trace of the old mortification, who leaves the
city and the market-place, and the thick of the fray,
and the ordering of others, and flies to the mountain,
and if anyone ask why he retires, he will discover no
sound reason for it. He says: &lsquo;I withdraw that I
may not perish, and that I may not become weak in
goodness&rsquo;. How much better it would be that you
<i>should</i> grow weaker and gain others, than remain on
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
the heights and see your brethren perishing. Now,
when some neglect goodness, and others who <i>do</i>
care for it are withdrawn from their rank in the
fight, how shall we gain our enemies? If signs
took place now, who would be convinced? Or who
of those without would attach himself to us whilst
vice is so apparent? An upright life on our part
seems to the multitude more convincing. For signs
from shameless and bad men arouse a suspicion of
evil, but a pure life is able to shut the devil&rsquo;s mouth
with great force. These things I say both to rulers
and ruled, and to myself, before all, in order that we
may show forth an admirable life, and, forming ourselves
into battle array, may disregard all present
things. Let us despise money, and not despise hell;
think little of fame, but not little of our salvation;
let us endure struggles and labours here, that there
we may not encounter chastisement. Thus let us
fight the heathen, thus let us take them prisoners in
a captivity which is better than freedom. But we
talk persistently and often about these things, and
scarcely ever do them. However, whether we do
them or not, it is right always to insist upon them.
For if some cheat through fine words, how much
more should those who are leading others to the
truth not weary of speaking what is due. For if
cheaters make use of these tactics&mdash;for they lay up
money, and bring arguments to bear, and encounter
dangers, and make their power felt&mdash;how much
more should we, who lead men away from deceit,
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
endure dangers, and death, and all things, so that,
gaining ourselves and others, and standing invincibly
against our adversaries, we may arrive at the
promised goods in Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom
be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="c31"><span class="sc">The Secret of our Faith.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, iii., vol. ii., p. 27.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Show me, if you can, whether Peter and Paul
were scholars. But you cannot; for they were
ordinary men and unlettered.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Just as Christ, when
He sent His disciples out into the world, showed
His power first to them in Palestine, saying, <i>When
I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you
want anything?</i> Afterwards He charged them to
have a scrip and a purse, and so He did in this case.
For that which was aimed at was to show the power
of Christ, not that the lack of external accomplishments
should cause those who approached to be
rejected from the faith. Now, whenever heathens
accuse the disciples of being unlearned, let us be
even louder than they in our accusations. Let no
one say that Paul was skilful, but praising great
men amongst them for their skill, and those remarkable
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
for their clever speeches, let us say that
all of ours are unlearned. We shall not a little
overthrow them on this side too, so brilliant will be
the victory. I have said these things because I
once heard a Christian making himself ridiculous in
discussion with a heathen, and each in their fight
against the other destroying his own side. That
which the Christian should have said the heathen
said, and that which it would have been natural for
the heathen to say the Christian put forward. For,
Paul and Plato forming the subject of dispute, the
heathen, on the one hand, tried to show that Paul
was uneducated and unlearned, and, on the other,
the Christian, out of simplicity, was all eager to
prove that Paul was a better reasoner than Plato.
Thus the heathen gained the victory, as this consideration
prevailed. For, if Paul <i>had</i> been a better
dialectician than Plato, many would naturally have
used the argument that he succeeded through his
skilful speech rather than by grace. So the
Christian&rsquo;s argument told for the heathen, and the
heathen&rsquo;s for the Christian. For if Paul was untaught
and still conquered Plato, as I have said, it
was a triumphant victory. The unlearned Paul,
taking Plato&rsquo;s disciples, convinced them and drew
them to himself. Hence, it is evident that the
Gospel was not preached by human wisdom, but
by the grace of God. In order, then, that we may
not encounter the same defeat, nor make ourselves
ridiculous when we are thus in discussion with
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
heathens, let us condemn the Apostles as unlearned:
this very condemnation is praise. And when they
tell us that the Apostles were rustic, let us admit
and confess that they were untaught, and unlearned,
and poor, and needy, and unintelligent, and obscure.
This is no blasphemy of the Apostles, but their
glory, that, being what they were, they appeared
more famous than the whole world. Those very
unlearned, rustic, untaught men beat down men
wise in their conceits, powerful men, tyrants, men
who were enjoying riches and glory and all outward
goods, as if they had not been men at all. Whence
it is clear that the power of the Cross was great,
and that it was not through human strength that
these things took place. They do not, indeed, come
from nature at all, but that which was accomplished
was above nature. Whenever something
takes place which is above nature, and very much
above it, and is also opportune and good, it is
evident that it happens by a certain divine power
and co-operation. For, consider&mdash;a fisherman, a
tent-maker, a publican, an unlearned man, and an
untaught man, coming from their outlandish province
of Palestine, drove out from their own stronghold
philosophers, and orators, and rhetoricians, and
overcame them in a short time in the midst of many
dangers, peoples and kings resisting them, nature
itself being adverse: inveterate custom, force of
habit, fighting them to the teeth: evil spirits armed
against them: the devil in agitation setting all
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
things in motion&mdash;monarchies, and rulers, and
democracies, and nations, and cities, barbarians,
heathens, philosophers, orators, sophists, lawmakers,
laws, tribunals, every sort of chastisement, and
manifold deaths. And yet all these things were
overcome, and gave way at the voice of fishermen,
just as a little dust which is unable to resist the
force of strong winds. Let us learn, therefore, so to
speak with the heathens as not to be like a herd of
sheep or cattle, but let us be prepared to prove the
hope which is in us. And, meanwhile, let us insist
on the chief point, which is no small one, and say to
them, How was it that the weak circumvented the
strong, that twelve men conquered the world, not
in the strength of their own weapons, but in their
nakedness fighting armed men? For, say, if twelve
men, inexperienced in war, breaking in upon a huge
array of armed warriors, not only weaponless themselves,
but feeble in body, were to suffer nothing at
their hands, and were to escape scatheless from a
thousand missiles, and, standing in their midst with
unprotected bodies, were to put them all to flight,
not using weapons, but fighting with their hands,
slaying some and taking others into captivity, and
not receiving a scratch themselves, nor reached by a
thousand blows aimed at them&mdash;who would ascribe
this to man alone? Yet the victory of the Apostles
was far more wonderful than this. For it is much
more stupendous that an unlearned man, an untaught
man, and a fisherman should circumvent so
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
much cleverness, than that an unarmed man should
come scatheless out of the fight: that they should
be held back neither by their small numbers nor
their poverty, nor by dangers, nor by force of habit,
nor by the difficulty of the enterprise which they
had undertaken, nor by death looking them daily
in the face, nor by the multitude of those deceived,
nor by the fame of deceivers.</p>
<p>In like manner, then, let us overthrow them,
and fight against them, and let us strike them
down rather by our life than by arguments. For
this is the great strife, and the most unanswerable
argument is that of works, since we may
philosophise with our tongues in a thousand ways,
and yet if we show not forth a better life than
theirs, we gain nothing whatever. They do not give
heed to our reasonings, but take note of what we do,
and they say, &lsquo;First yield obedience to your own
words, and then advise others. If you speak of the
innumerable goods of the next world, and yet seem
to be given up to present ones, as if those others did
not exist, your deeds are more convincing to me
than your words. For when I see you seizing
others&rsquo; property, grieving inordinately over the dead,
committing many other sins, how can I believe you
when you tell me that there is a resurrection?&rsquo;
Even if they do not put this into words, they think
it, and bear it in their minds. And this it is which
prevents infidels from becoming Christians. Let us,
then, lead them by our life. Many illiterate men
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
have thus struck down the mind of philosophers, by
showing them the philosophy of works, sending forth
a voice louder than a trumpet through their own
manner of life and conduct: this voice is indeed
much more powerful than the tongue. Whenever I
say that it is not lawful to bear malice to anyone,
and then injure a heathen in a thousand ways, how
shall I be able to persuade him by my words since I
frighten him away by my deeds? Let us, therefore,
catch them by our daily life, and build up the
Church through these souls, and collect this wealth.
Nothing whatsoever is of so much worth as a soul,
not even the whole world. If you should give
thousands of pounds to the poor, you do nothing
in comparison to the one who converts a soul. <i>He
who makes an honourable man out of a worthless one
shall be as My mouth</i>, God says. Compassion for the
poor is also a great good, but it is nothing compared
to withdrawing a soul from error; the man who
does this becomes like Peter and Paul. For we
may point out the Gospel which they preached; not
that we be imperilled as they were, and have hunger
and pestilence and other evils to endure, for this is
a time of peace, but so that we may show forth the
zeal of a willing spirit. <i>This</i> fishing may, indeed, be
carried out by those who sit at home. If any man
have a friend, or relation, or servant, this let him do
and say, and he will become like Peter and Paul.
And why do I say Peter and Paul? He will be the
mouth of Christ. For <i>he who makes an honourable</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
<i>man out of a worthless one shall be as My mouth</i>, He
says. If you should not persuade to-day, you will
to-morrow, and, even if you never persuade at all,
you will have the full reward. And if you cannot
persuade all, you can persuade a few out of many,
since the Apostles themselves did not convince all
the men of their day; but still they conversed with
them all, and have the reward for all. For God is
wont to bestow His crowns, not according to what
is accomplished by good deeds, but according to the
intention of those who do them. If you put down
only two mites He receives them, and He will do for
those who teach what He did for the widow.
Therefore, because you are not able to save the
world, do not despise the few, nor turn away from
small things in your desire for great things. If you
cannot give a hundred, look after the ten; and if
you cannot give ten, do not despise the five; and if
five are beyond you, do not overlook the one; and if
you cannot even give the one, do not lose courage,
and do not neglect your part.</p>

<h3 id="c32"><span class="sc">The Victory of Our Faith.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lxxv., vol. ii., p. 376.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>We may wonder the more at the power of Christ,
and at the courage of the Apostles, because they
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
were announcing the Gospel at the very time when
everything Jewish was particularly attacked, and
the Jews were proscribed as seditious, and the
Roman emperor commanded their total dispersion.
And this happened in a state of things which we
may describe in this way. There is a great tempest
at sea, the whole atmosphere is wrapped in darkness,
wreck follows upon wreck, on board all the
sailors are in open rebellion, and from below
monsters are darting up, and together with the
waves are destroying the men; thunderbolts are
falling, pirates attacking, and on board all is mutiny.
Suppose that in this extremity anyone should order
men who were ignorant of nautical matters, nor
even knew the sea, to sit at the rudder, to guide the
helm, and to fight their way. And then, in the face
of an experienced crew equipped with much labour
suppose that these men should use a light boat, in
the state of tumult which I have described, and
overcome and master it. For as Jews they were
hated by the Gentile world, and as the enemies of
their own laws they were stoned by the Jews; nowhere
was there any standing-ground. Thus, on all
sides there were precipices, chasms, and rocks;
cities, country-places, dwelling-houses, offered them
nothing else; one and all opposed them&mdash;commander,
and magistrate, and the man in private
life, all races and all peoples&mdash;and there was a
disturbance with which men could not reason. For,
indeed, the Jewish race was exceedingly hateful to
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
the Roman rulers, inasmuch as it had caused them
trouble in a thousand ways, and yet the Gospel
tidings were not prejudiced thereby, but the city
itself was ravaged and set on fire, and numberless
ills fell upon its inhabitants. Nevertheless the
Apostles, going forth from that city, bringing in new
laws, mastered even the Romans. Oh, what new
and wonderful deeds are these! The Romans at that
time subdued countless thousands of Jews, and they
did <i>not</i> circumvent twelve poor unarmed men.
What words can adequately express this wonder?
For there are two things which teachers should
possess&mdash;the being worthy of confidence and the
love of their disciples; and over and above these,
that what they say should be well received, and the
time in which they say it free from agitation and
fear. But then everything was just the reverse.
For neither did they appear to be worthy of confidence,
and yet they were to detach those whom men,
apparently thus worthy, had deceived. They were
not loved, but even hated, and they drew men off
from those things which they clung to, from habits of
life, and from country, and from laws. Moreover, their
injunctions were exceedingly hard, but those from
which they took men were most pleasant. Many
were the dangers and the deaths to be encountered
both by them themselves and by those who listened to
them; and with all this, the time itself was a time of
great trouble, fruitful in wars, tumults, and agitation,
so that if there had been no one of the things
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
which we have enumerated, it alone might have
upset everything. We may say, pertinently: <i>Who
shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth
all His praises?</i> For if the friends of Moses did not
listen to him when he spoke with miraculous signs
simply because of bricks and clay, who was able to
withdraw from an idle life men who day after day
are killed and slaughtered, and are suffering intolerable
evils? Who was able to make them prefer this
insecure life of blood-shedding and death even to the
other, the heralds of these tidings being of another
race, and on all accounts most hostile? Let a man
bring in, not to a race, or city, or people, but into
one small household, one who is hated by everybody
in it, and let him try hard through that person to
withdraw men from those he loves, from father and
wife and children, will he not be seen torn to pieces
before he opens his mouth? And if he bring to the
house contention and strife between husband and
wife, will they not take and stone him before he again
crosses the threshold? If besides he is contemptible,
and yet enjoins disagreeable things, ordering luxurious
men to practise an ascetic life; and with all
this, if the combat be against men much more
numerous and powerful than himself, is it not
evident that he is wholly undone? And yet this
very thing which it was impossible to do in one
household is what Christ has done in the whole
world, through precipice and fire, and chasm and
rock, with earth and sea fighting against Him, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
introducing the healers of the world. And if you
wish to learn these things more accurately,&mdash;I mean
famines, and plagues, and earthquakes, and other
visitations,&mdash;go over the history of these things as it
is contained in Josephus, and you will see it all most
clearly. This is why He Himself said: <i>Be not
disturbed, for all things must come about</i>; and <i>He who
perseveres unto the end shall be saved</i>; and again, <i>This
Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world</i>.
For He revives those who are discouraged and
drooping for fear at what He has told them, by
saying, that whatever happens, the Gospel must be
preached in every part of the world, and that then
the end will come. Do you see what a state things
were in at that time, and how war was everywhere?
And this at the outset, when that which is established
most especially requires much peace. Now, what
was this state? There is no reason why we should
not recapitulate the same things. The first war was
that of deceivers, for He said: <i>There shall arise false
Christs and false prophets</i>; the second, that of the
Romans: <i>You are about to hear wars</i>; the third was
that which was to bring in famine; the fourth, that
of plagues and earthquakes; the fifth, <i>They shall give
you up to fear</i>; the sixth, <i>You shall be hated by all</i>;
the seventh, <i>They shall traduce and hate each other</i>;
hence clearly civil war; hence false Christs and
false brethren; hence <i>Charity shall grow cold</i>, which
is the cause of all evils without exception. Do you
see how war was there in every shape, both novel
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
and marvellous? Still, with all this and much more
(for war amongst kindred was added to civil discord),
the Gospel tidings took possession of the whole
world. <i>For</i>, He said, <i>the Gospel shall be preached in the
whole world</i>.</p>

<h3 id="c33"><span class="sc">Marriages as they were and as they are.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lxxiii., vol. ii., p. 355.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Have you not heard that men and women were
assembled together in the upper room, and that that
gathering was worthy of heaven? And with reason.
The women of those days put in practice a high
ascetic life, and men were grave and wise. Listen
at least to the seller of purple saying: <i>If you have
judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come unto my house
and abide there</i>. Listen to the women who followed
the Apostles about from place to place with the
spirit of true men&mdash;a Priscilla, and a Persis, and the
others&mdash;from whom the women of to-day are as far
removed as the men are from the men. For then
even when going about they gave no scandal, but
now, delicately nurtured in their houses, they hardly
avoid this suspicion. These scandals arise from
people decking themselves out and from luxury.
Those women of old made it their business to spread
abroad the Gospel tidings: <i>now</i> women&rsquo;s anxiety is
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
to have fine figures and comely faces. They care no
more for their good name than for their salvation;
and as to high and great deeds of goodness, they do
not even dream of them. What woman shows
eagerness to make her husband better? What man
is anxious to bring his wife to amendment? Not
one; but the wife&rsquo;s whole anxiety is about jewels and
clothes, and the other adornments of the body, and
how she may increase her substance; and the husband&rsquo;s
is the same, except that he has many more
cares, and they are all worldly cares. Who that is
about to marry would inquire into the girl&rsquo;s manners
and education? No one; but he would be particular
enough about money and land, and the
accurate estimate of her fortune, as if he were going
to buy something, or to carry out some low contract.
This is why they speak of marriage as a contract.
For I have heard many say, &lsquo;Such a man has made
a contract with such a girl; that is, he has married&rsquo;.
They trample upon the very gifts of God, and marry
and are married, as if they were buyers and sellers.
Indeed, deeds require more accuracy than the business
of buying and selling. Consider how men
married of old, and emulate their example. Now,
<i>how</i> did they marry? They enquired about the ways
and habits of their bride, and about her goodness of
heart. Therefore they had no need of contracts, nor
of pen-and-ink settlements; the bride&rsquo;s character
was everything to them. So I admonish you, too,
not to look for money and wealth, but for disposition
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
and goodness. Seek out a virtuous and earnest girl,
and she will be of more worth to you than thousands
of pounds. If you look for the things of God, the
other things will come of themselves; but if you
pass over the former and insist on the latter, you
will not gain even these. But you will say, &lsquo;Such
a man became rich through his wife&rsquo;. Are you not
ashamed to bring forward such instances? I have
heard many say, &lsquo;I would rather be poor a thousand
times over than grow wealthy through my wife&rsquo;.
For what is more unacceptable than that wealth?
What is more pungent than that abundance? What
is more humiliating than to be the man thus noted
and pointed at by everyone as the &lsquo;man who
became rich through his wife&rsquo;. I would set forth
the domestic vexations which would of necessity
befal this man from his act, viz., his wife&rsquo;s temper,
his state of slavery, their contentions, the scoffs of
servants who call him &lsquo;a poor beggar, a nobody
sprung from nowhere, for what had he to offer?
Did not everything belong to the lady?&rsquo; But these
words make no impression on you, for you have not
an independent spirit. Since toad-eaters, too, have
to hear what is still more outrageous, and do not
care, so neither are these men troubled, but they
glory in their shamelessness, and when we talk to
them about it, one of them answers, &lsquo;Let me alone,
it is very pleasant; and it can put an end to me for
all I care&rsquo;. Oh! the malice of the devil for making
certain sayings commonplaces in life, which are
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
capable of poisoning the whole existence of such
men. See, at least, what deadly havoc this one
diabolical phrase works; for it says in so many
words, &lsquo;Have no care for sobriety or for justice:
let everything of the kind be thrown aside, and look
only for one thing&mdash;pleasure&rsquo;. Even if this pursuit
oppress you, choose it; even if all who meet you
spit upon you, and throw mud in your eyes, and
drive you about like a dog, bear it. What else could
swine say if they had a voice? or unclean dogs?
Indeed, often <i>they</i> would not give voice to those
things which the devil has induced men to rave
about. Therefore I strongly advise those who know
the heartlessness of these words to fly from such proverbial
sayings, and to confute them by the contrary
ones of Holy Scripture. Which are they? <i>Go not
after thy lusts, and turn away from thy own will.</i>
And, again, concerning the harlot, its words are
opposed to that other phrase: <i>Mind not the deceit
of a woman. For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb
dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil. But
her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged
sword.</i> Let us listen to these, and not to those
words. For on the latter base-minded and servile
men ground their sophistry; hence, in this, men
become unreasoning things, in that they elect to
seek pleasure everywhere according to the world&rsquo;s
standard, which is despicable even apart from our
showing. For after the surfeiting, what is the gain
of a sweet taste? Cease, then, from this mirth,
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
and from committing yourselves to hell and the
unquenchable fire, and let us look forward as we
ought to the things to come, putting off the scales
from our eyes, so that we may reach that future life
in due time in great piety and contentment, and
may gain its good things through the love and kindness
of Our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be power
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<br />(<i>Homilies de Statuis</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> xxi., <i>preached at Antioch</i>, tom. ii., p. 2.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Since, therefore, we melt down the gold of the
Apostle&rsquo;s mines, not throwing it into the furnace,
but putting it by in the understanding of our soul,
not enkindling a flame, but the fire of the Spirit, let
us pick up diligently even the tiny shavings. For if
the word is brief, its power is great. If the special
worth of pearls lies not in their bulk but in their
beauty, so is it in the reading of the Divine Scriptures.
On the one hand, secular education has a
care for much that is trifling, is full of silly talk to
its pupils, and sends them away empty-handed,
without gain small or great. It is not so with the
grace of the Spirit, but just the contrary. By a few
words it brings asceticism before all, and often one
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
word is sufficient for the provision of a whole lifetime.</p>
<p>Since we have this wealth before us, let us rouse
ourselves, and receive these words with a pure mind.
And I am prepared to show that this word (of St.
Paul to St. Timothy) contains a great deal. This
advice has seemed to many superfluous and trifling,
and they make some such remark as, &lsquo;Might not
Timothy have known himself how much wine he
was to take, without waiting to be told it by his
master?&rsquo; Now, as the master not only gave the
order, but enforced it by letter, as on a metal slab,
in the epistle which he wrote to him, was he not
ashamed to establish a rule for such things in
writing to his disciple? Learn, then, that this
advice, far from being superfluous, was necessary
and most useful. It is not Paul&rsquo;s doing, but the
grace of the Spirit. I am speaking not only of its
having been said, but also of its having been made
emphatic in writing, and published by this same
epistle to all future generations. I shall come
presently to this proof. Together with the remarks
I have noted, some people question another and a
not less important point, asking themselves why
God allowed a man of so great courage, whose bones
and body put forth devils, to fall into this great
bodily weakness; for he was not merely ill, he was
always and persistently ill with illnesses following
close upon each other, so as to leave him no breathing
time. How do we know this? From Paul&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
own words; for he did not say, <i>because of thy infirmity</i>,
nor thy infirmities alone, but to show that
they were constant he said, <i>thy frequent infirmities</i>.
Let as many as are given up to a long sickness,
and are in great distress and weariness, listen to
this. Our enquiry does not concern itself only
with the fact that, being a holy man, he was sick,
or that he was so thus constantly, but that he
was entrusted with the concerns of the world. If
he had been one of those dwellers on the mountain
heights, or bound fast to a tent in the desert, and
thus leading a life without business, the question
would be less puzzling; but exposed to view as he
was, with the cares of churches so great upon him,
traversing entire cities and countries, and the whole
world itself, with so much readiness, that <i>he</i> should
have been given up to the powerlessness of illness,
this it is which is the most perplexing of all to a man
without reflection; for if not for himself, he wanted
his health for others. He was an excellent general:
he had waged war, he said, not against unbelievers
only, but against demons and the devil himself. All
his enemies were fiercely assailing him, dispersing
his army, and taking it captive. This man could
lead thousands to the truth, and he was sick. If no
further harm than this had been done to our work
by that illness, a man says, that alone was sufficient
to make believers grow more careless and negligent.
If soldiers see their general confined to bed, they
grow careless and less eager for battle; so it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
much more natural that the faithful of those days,
seeing the master who worked signs so great constantly
ill and weak in his body, should suffer,
humanly speaking, at the sight. This is not all; but
enquiries go on to something else, and ask again why
neither he cured himself, nor his master, who saw him
thus prostrated, cured him either; whereas they were
raising the dead, and casting out demons, and conquering
death with authority, they did <i>not</i> cure this
one sick body; and whilst in life and in death they
were showing forth a wonderful power in other
bodies, they did <i>not</i> restore this ailing stomach.
And, what is more, Paul was not ashamed, after
wonders so great as he had shown forth, by a mere
word writing to Timothy, of advising him to try the
remedy of wine-drinking. Not that drinking wine is
bad. Far from it. This is what heretics assert;
but that he deemed it not beneath him that the cure
of one sick member could not be affected without
this help. He was so far from being ashamed of this
that he made it clear to all succeeding generations.
Do you see how deeply we have gone into the
matter: how that which appears a small thing gives
rise to endless questions? Let us, then, add the
explanation, for we <i>have</i> gone into it thus deeply in
order to rouse your minds and establish them in
security.</p>
<p>You must allow me, before coming to the explanation
in question, to say something about Timothy&rsquo;s
goodness and Paul&rsquo;s care for him. What was
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
kinder than he, who at so great a distance, and in a
round of so much business, made the well-being of
his disciple&rsquo;s stomach his care, and told him clearly
what to do for his restoration to health? And what
could equal Timothy&rsquo;s virtue? He so looked down
on luxury and scorned a rich table as to grow weak
from his extreme severity and excessive fasting.
Listen to Paul&rsquo;s words plainly showing that he was
not this by nature, but that he had lost his strength
of stomach through fasting and water drinking; for
he did not merely say, <i>Use a little wine</i>, but saying
in the first place, <i>Do not still drink water</i>, he added
his counsel about drinking wine. The <i>still</i> was a
proof that until then he had drunk water, and had
so become weak. Who would not be struck with his
mortification and severity of life? Timothy was
taking heaven itself by storm, and pressing on to the
height of virtue, and to this his master bears witness
in the words: <i>I have sent you Timothy, who is my
beloved child and faithful in the Lord</i>. Now, when
Paul calls him his child, and his faithful and beloved
child, these words sufficiently show all his worth;
for the judgments of the saints are not given either
out of love or hatred, but are free from all prejudice.
If Timothy had been Paul&rsquo;s child according to
nature, he would not have been as enviable as he is
now renowned, for whereas Timothy was nothing to
him according to the flesh, through the attraction
of piety he drew him into his sonship, preserving
carefully in all things the characteristics of Timothy&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
asceticism. Just as a calf yoked with a bull, so did
Timothy bear the yoke with him all over the world,
and made no difference as he grew older, but his
ardour induced him to vie with the labours of his
master. Paul, again, witnesses to this, saying: <i>Let
no one set him at nought, for he is doing the Lord&rsquo;s work
as I am myself</i>. Do you see how he proclaims
Timothy&rsquo;s zeal as equal to his own? And that
you may not think that favouring prompted him so
to speak, he makes his listeners themselves witnesses
of his child&rsquo;s goodness, saying: <i>You know what his
test has been; how he has served with me in the Gospel
as a child his father. You have had a proof by
this of his virtue and of his tried spirit.</i> Yet whilst
Timothy was rising to these great heights of goodness,
he did not presume of himself. On the contrary,
he was in wrestling and fear. On this account he
was diligent in fasting, and did not act as the majority
of men do, who, having given themselves up to fasting,
some for ten months only, others for twenty,
suddenly break up everything. He did not suffer
this, nor did he say anything of this kind within himself:
&lsquo;Why should I go on fasting? I have got the
better of myself: I have conquered my desires, I
have mortified my body, I have terrified demons, I
have cast out the devil, I have raised the dead, I
have cleansed lepers, the opposing powers hold me
in fear, what further need have I of fasting and of
the weakness which it brings?&rsquo; He said none of
these things, nor were they in his mind; but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
greater his abundance of good deeds, the more he
feared and trembled, and this asceticism he had
learnt from his master; for he who had been rapt
into the third heaven and taken into paradise, who
had heard ineffable words and had participated in
mysteries so high, who had traversed the whole
world as if with wings, said, in writing to the
Corinthians: <i>I fear lest, having preached to others, I
myself should be cast out</i>. Now, if Paul, who was able
to say, <i>The world is crucified to me and I to the
world</i>, is in fear after all these his wonderful deeds,
how much more should <i>we</i> fear, and this should increase
in proportion to the number of our good actions.
For the devil storms and rages the more when he sees
us ordering our lives with care. When he sees much
goodness pressed together and an accumulation of
merits, then it is that he sets himself to bring about
a completer shipwreck. For a poor and abject man,
even if he be supplanted and fall, does not so injure
the common good. Now, when he who stands, as it
were, gloriously on the heights of virtue, seen and
known to all, the object of general admiration, falls
into temptation, he effects great ruin and havoc, not
only because he fell from a high place, but also
because he made those who looked up to him more
slothful. Just as in the body, when a member
withers up, the harm is not great, yet, if the eyes fail
or the head is injured, the whole body becomes useless,
so is it with the saints and with those who do
great things. When these are extinguished, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
they admit any stain, they work immense harm to
the whole body.</p>
<p>Now, Timothy had all this before him, and he
fortified himself on all sides; for he knew that youth
is hard to manage: unstable, easily deceived, unsteady,
and that it needs a strong bridle; for it is a
pyre which embraces all external things and is easily
ignited. Therefore, he was careful to put a check
upon it on all sides, and he tried in every way to
quench this fire, and he drove the horse, which was
unruly and refractory, with much spirit, until he had
broken him in and made him obedient, and brought
a strong hand to bear upon him, so that he listened to
reason&rsquo;s word of command: &lsquo;Let my body be weak
but not my soul,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Let the flesh be bridled,
and my soul in its course heavenwards not be impeded.&rsquo;
Together with this, what we should especially
wonder at in him was, that weakened down as
he thus was, and fighting with weakness, he did not
neglect God&rsquo;s work, but was more active than those
in full and robust health. He was seen with his
master, now at Ephesus, now at Corinth, often in
Macedonia, in Italy, everywhere by land and by sea,
ever taking part in his toils and in his continual
dangers, nor did his weakness of body get the better
of his asceticism of spirit. This is zeal according to
God, which makes high-soaring easy. Thus, they
who are in good case and sound in body will gain
nothing by it if their soul be cast down, and soft, and
slothful; so the weak will not be harmed by their
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
want of health if their soul be strong and alert.
Now, this advice and counsel seem to some to warrant
unlimited wine-drinking, which is by no means
the case. If anyone would weigh the word carefully,
he would find it is rather an exhortation to
fasting. For consider, this advice of Paul&rsquo;s was
given not from the first and at the outset. It was
given when he knew that Timothy&rsquo;s whole strength
was broken, and even then not unrestrictedly, but
with a condition. He did not merely say, <i>Use wine</i>,
but, <i>a little wine</i>, and this not because Timothy required
the advice, but because <i>we</i> do. Therefore, in
writing to him, he limits and restricts wine-drinking,
telling him to drink as much as would overcome
weakness, and restore health to the body; not what
would encourage another complaint. Immoderate
wine-drinking breeds complaints no less than excessive
water-drinking, or rather much worse ones, both
in soul and body. It incites the war of passions,
and leads a tempest of foolish fancies into the mind,
weakens and enervates strength of body. An abundance
of water falling on the earth does not more
persistently break up the soil than constant wine-drinking
does bodily strength by weakening and wasting
it. Let us, therefore, avoid both extremes, and
take care of our health, whilst we keep it within due
bounds. For wine was given us by God, not that we
should be drunk with it, but that we should be temperate,
that we should be made glad and not sorry.
<i>Wine rejoices the heart of man</i>, the Scripture says.
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
Now, you turn it into a course for despondency.
Those who drink too much are sullen, and their
reason is overclouded. Used with moderation, it is
the best medicine. This will be a useful argument
against heretics who attack what God has made.
If it had been forbidden, Paul would not have counselled
it, nor have said, <i>Use wine</i>. And not against
heretics only is it good, but against our own simpler
brethren, who, when they see certain men degrading
themselves by drink, instead of blaming <i>them</i>, attack
God&rsquo;s gift, saying, <i>Let there be no wine</i>. Then we
may answer them: &lsquo;Let there be no drunkenness&rsquo;.
For wine is God&rsquo;s, whilst drunkenness is the devil&rsquo;s.
It is not wine which makes inebriety, but intemperance.
Do not slander God&rsquo;s creature, but the madness
of your fellow-man. Will you neglect to punish
and correct the sinner whilst you despise the Benefactor?</p>

<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Since, then, the things which we see are temporary,
but the things which we do not see eternal, let
us turn our minds to these. For what excuse should
we have for choosing passing things instead of eternal
ones? If the present time be indeed pleasant, it
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
does not last, whilst the pain which it produces
endures relentlessly.</p>
<p>How will those who have been made worthy of
the Spirit be justified, enjoying so great a gift, if
they remain crawling upon the earth and clinging to
it? For I hear many men making use of foolish
speeches, such as: &lsquo;Give me to-day and take to-morrow;
for, if things are what you pretend hereafter,
it is one thing against another; but, supposing
there is no hereafter at all, it is two things instead
of nothing&rsquo;. What is more senseless or more idle
than such words? We are talking about heaven
and the ineffable goods of eternity, and you bring
before us the arguments of a racing-course, and are
not ashamed to speak words worthy of madmen.
Do you not blush so to cleave to present things?
Will you not desist from madness and foolishness,
and from wasting your youth? That heathens
should speak in this way is not astonishing, but
what will believing men who so rave have to say for
themselves? Would you call in question those immortal
hopes or doubt them altogether?</p>
<p>And what is your excuse? &lsquo;Who has ever come,&rsquo;
you say, &lsquo;and told us about the next world?&rsquo; No
man ever did; but God, Who is the most worthy of
belief, has revealed these things. &lsquo;But we cannot
see them.&rsquo; Neither can you see God; and do you
doubt His existence because you cannot see Him?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I believe in it most thoroughly,&rsquo; you say. Now,
then, if an unbeliever ask you, &lsquo;Who has ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
come from heaven and told us these things?&rsquo; what
will you answer? How do you know that there is a
God? &lsquo;From visible things,&rsquo; you reply; &lsquo;from the
order which is in the whole creation; from the fact
that this is evident to all.&rsquo; Therefore, apply the same
argument to that which concerns judgment. &lsquo;How
am I to do this?&rsquo; you ask. I will tell you, and you
will say if I am right. Is God just, and does He
give to each one according to his works, or, on the
contrary, is it His wish that the wicked should do
well and feast, and the good be in trouble and want?
&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; you say; &lsquo;for not even a man would
suffer this.&rsquo; Then where are those who are upright
here to enjoy good things? Where are the wicked
to suffer, if there is to be no future life and no retribution
after this world? Do you see that so far it is one
against one, and not two things instead of one? I
am showing you that the just will have not one thing
rather than another, but two things rather than nothing,
and that with sinners and those who feast here
just the reverse is the case. For those who feast in this
world have not even one thing against another, but
those who persevere in virtue have two things instead
of nothing. Who will be in refreshment&mdash;those who
misuse this present life or those who lead an ascetic
one? You say the former, but I point out the latter,
and call in as witnesses those very people who have
enjoyed present things, and they will not be ashamed
of what I am going to say. For they have often
cursed match-makers and the day on which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
marriage-tie was completed, and have envied the
unmarried. Many young men, who could easily
have married, have desisted for no other reason except
its irksomeness. I say this, not in disparagement
of marriage&mdash;for it is honourable&mdash;but against
those who misuse it. For if married people have
often called their life insupportable, what shall we
say of those who have fallen into the abysses of lust,
and who have led a life more slavish and miserable
than any captivity?&mdash;of those who have rotted in
luxury, and drawn down a hundred disorders upon
their body? &lsquo;Still,&rsquo; you answer, &lsquo;it is pleasant to
be somebody.&rsquo; Nothing in the world is bitterer
than this servitude. The vain man and he who
wishes to please all-comers is more servile than any
slave; whereas he who looks down upon vainglory
is exalted above all, and troubles himself not with
what others say. &lsquo;But having money is delightful.&rsquo;
We have often shown you that those are in greater
plenty and refreshment who have given up these
things and are rather possessors of nothing. &lsquo;But
drunkenness is pleasant.&rsquo; Who would say so?
Therefore, if poverty is pleasanter than riches, the
unmarried rather than the married life, obscurity
rather than reputation, fasting than feasting, it
follows that those have the most who do not cleave
to present things. I mean that the one, although he
may be torn with numberless cares, rests on a good
hope; whereas the other, even if he enjoy luxury a
thousand times over, has fear of the future to spoil
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
and mar his pleasure. And this is indeed not a
slight punishment, as it is destructive to feasting
and enjoyment. Together with these there is a
third sort of punishment. What is this? That
earthly feasting is seen to have no real existence,
since nature and the action of time disprove it;
whereas eternal things not only do exist, but remain
unchanged. Do you see that it is not only two
things against nothing, but three, five, ten, twenty,
or a thousand against nothing. In order to teach
you this from an example, take the case of Dives
and Lazarus: the one enjoyed the present life and
the other eternal life. Now, does it seem to you
that you can set the one thing against the other: to
be chastised for ever and to suffer hunger for a short
time; to be sick in a perishing body, and to be
burnt in a fierce fire with an immortal body; to be
crowned, and to feed on eternal goods after short
suffering, and to be tortured endlessly after a brief
enjoyment of temporal things? Who would say so?
What would you have me reckon? Quantity,
quality, order, God&rsquo;s determination respecting each
of us? How long will you speak as an insect might
who is always wallowing in the mire?</p>
<p>It does not belong to consistent men to throw
away so precious a soul for anything whatsoever,
when a little labour is required to conquer heaven.
Shall I show you by another example that a formidable
tribunal is awaiting us there? Open the door
of your conscience and see the judge who is sitting
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
in your mind. If you exercise judgment upon yourself,
selfish as you are, and could not bear the judgment
not to be just, how much more will God have
a care for the righteous, and judge every man impartially
rather than allow all things to be carried
out for nothing and in vain! Who, indeed, would
say this? No man whatsoever, but heathens, barbarians,
poets, philosophers, and all the human race
will agree with us in these matters, if not in the
same way, and will admit that there is some kind of
tribunal in hell, because the thing is so clear and
evident.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why,&rsquo; you ask, &lsquo;does He not chastise in
this world?&rsquo; In order that He may show forth
His own long-suffering, and give us an opportunity
of salvation by contrition; that He may not use
harshness with our race, nor deprive of salvation
those who may be saved by a perfect conversion.
If He immediately chastised sins and destroyed
sinners, how would Paul have been saved or Peter,
the chief teachers of the world
(<span title="hoi koryphaioi t&ecirc;s oikoumen&ecirc;s didaskaloi">&omicron;&#7985; &kappa;&omicron;&rho;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;&#8150;&omicron;&iota; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &omicron;&#7984;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; &delta;&iota;&delta;&#8049;&sigma;&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;</span>)?
How would David have reaped
salvation from his repentance? or the Galatians? or
many others? This is why He does not demand
the payment of every penalty here, but some of the
whole number, nor all there, but one man pays in
this world and another in the next, in order that He
may arouse the most insensible through those whom
He chastises, and prove the future state through those
whom He does not chastise. See you not how many
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
men have received their punishment here&mdash;those, for
instance, who were buried by the tower, those
whose blood Pilate used for the sacrifices, those
amongst the Corinthians who died a premature
death for partaking unworthily of the mysteries; or
again, Pharaoh, or those amongst the Jews who were
slaughtered by the Gentiles, or so many others then,
and now, and at all times? And, again, many great
sinners have departed hence without paying any
penalty here, like the rich man in Lazarus&rsquo; case, and
numerous others. This he does, and so leads unbelievers
to future things, and makes believers more
fervent. <i>For God is a just, and a strong, and a long-suffering
judge, and remembers not His anger day by
day.</i> Yet, if we misuse His long-suffering, a time
will come when He will be patient no more, and
will instantly apply the penalty. Let us not then
encounter chastisement during endless ages for the
enjoyment of one moment, which is our present life,
but let us labour during this critical moment that
we may be crowned for ever. Do you not see that
this is how the majority of men act in worldly things?
And they choose a short labour in preference to a
long rest, even if the issue be unfavourable to them.
Here there is equality of labour and gain, or, on the
other hand, there is often endless labour and a small
harvest, or none at all; whereas in the case of the
kingdom the travail is little, and the pleasure great
and never-ending. For consider, the husbandman
toils all the year round, and towards the end of it he
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
is often defrauded of the fruits of his many labours.
Again, the sailor and the soldier are in wars and
toils till extreme old age, and it often chances that
each dies, the one without his wealth of cargoes, the
other losing his life as well as victory on the battlefield.
Now, tell me what excuse shall we have if we
choose labours in worldly things, that we may rest
for a while, or not even that, because hope is uncertain,
whereas in spiritual things we do the very
contrary, and draw down upon us an unspeakable
chastisement for the sake of short ease?</p>

<h3 id="c36"><span class="sc">The Word of Praise.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on Second Epistle to Corinthians</i>, i., vol. iii., p. 8.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let us not lose heart in temptation. For no
man that feasts, and slumbers, and flags, is united
to Christ, nor any of those who lead this soft and
dissolute life; but the man in tribulation and
temptation, he who walks on the narrow path, is
near to Christ. For this was His path, and so He
said: <i>The Son of man hath not whereon to lay His Head</i>.
Therefore do not grieve that you are tried, seeing
Whom you are like in this, how you are purified by
temptations, and what great things you gain. Nothing
is grievous except falling out with God.
Short of this neither tribulation, nor snares, nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
anything else, has power to afflict the wisely-tempered
soul; but just as a small spark falling into a
deep abyss goes out at once, so the force of despondency
sinking into a good conscience is destroyed and
quickly disappears. Thus it was that Paul always
rejoiced, since he drew his courage from the things
of God, and did not even perceive human evils: he
was grieved as a man, but did not fall. Thus, too,
that patriarch of old was in gladness whilst suffering
many painful things. For consider: he was
exiled from his country, he went through long and
grievous journeys, and coming to a foreign land,
he had not a place for the sole of his foot. After
that he was a prey to hunger, and it made him a
wanderer, and his hunger was followed by the
taking of his wife, by the fear of death, by childlessness,
and war, and dangers, and plottings, and at
last by the crowning and most bitter grief of all, the
slaughtering of his only son, the heir.</p>
<p>Do not think that, because he had so much endurance,
he went through these things without
suffering. For if he was just a thousand times over,
as indeed he was, he was still a man, and he had
the feelings of a man. Yet no one of these things
overthrew him, but he stood like a valiant combatant
with the laurel wreath, acclaimed with
applause in each race. Thus, too, blessed Paul,
exposed day by day to the snowstorms of temptation,
as if feasting in the midst of paradise, rejoiced
and exulted. Now, just as a man who is glad with
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
this gladness does not fall a prey to despondency,
so one who is not glad in this way is easily overcome
by everything, and he suffers as a man would, who
having insufficient armour should be wounded by a
chance shot. Not so the man who is safely armed
from head to foot: he wards off every assailing dart.
For, indeed, joy, according to God, is stronger than
any armour, and nothing can make such a man
downcast or sad, but he bears all things with fortitude.
What is more destructive than fire, or more
painful than constant tortures? Even if a man lose
a hundred possessions and children, and anything
else, this is the sharpest suffering: <i>Skin for skin, and
all that a man hath he will give for his life</i>. Nothing
could be harder to bear than pain. Still, that which
men deem unbearable becomes tolerable and desirable
through the gladness coming from God. If you
lead the martyr whilst still alive away from the cross
or the cauldron you will find this same joy within
his breast, which is not even to be described.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why should I suffer,&rsquo; you ask, &lsquo;since this is no
age for martyrdom?&rsquo; What are you saying, &lsquo;This is
no age for martyrdom&rsquo;? It has never ceased, but is
always before our eyes if we will be on the look-out.
It is not only hanging on the wood which makes a
martyr, for if this were the case, Job would be deprived
of this particular crown. He neither appeared
at a judgment-seat, nor heard the voice of a
judge, nor saw an executioner, nor raised in the air
and disjointed on the cross, were his ribs worn away.
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
Yet he bore stripes harder than many martyrs did,
and the voices of ceaseless messengers urged and tormented
him more sharply than any stripes, and those
worms devoured his flesh more rapidly than countless
executioners. Was he then not fully equal to a
martyr? He <i>was</i> a thousand times a martyr. He
wrestled in every single way, and was crowned; he
was tried by money losses, and by children, and bodily
sickness, and wife, and friends, and enemies, and servants,
for they also insulted him to his face; by hunger,
and curses, and pains, and stench. On this account I
should say that he would equal not one, or two, or
three, but many martyrs. Besides all this, the time
added greatly to his crowns: for instance, it was
before the law and the dispensation of grace, and he
suffered during many months and with intensity,
and all his misfortunes were laid upon him at once,
although each was in itself overwhelming, and that
which seemed the most grievous of all, the loss of
his wealth. Many at least have borne stripes but have
not borne the loss of property, and have chosen to
be scourged for it, and would rather have endured a
thousand other evils than any diminution of it, as
the loss of money appeared to them the greater
stripe. So this constitutes another kind of martyrdom
for the man who bears its loss with endurance.
And how shall we be sure of the endurance, you ask?
By understanding that you gain more than you have
lost by a single word, that of thanksgiving. If,
when we hear of our loss, we are not agitated, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
say, &lsquo;Praised be God,&rsquo; we have found something of
much greater worth. Indeed, you could not gain
rewards so high by distributing your riches to the
poor, nor by going about to seek out the needy, and
by lavishing your good things upon them, as you gain
by this one word. Hence, I admire Job not so much
when he opens his house to the poor, as I proclaim
and wonder at him for bearing the loss of his wealth
with thanksgiving. The same is evident in the case
of his children&rsquo;s death. You will receive a reward
not less than his was who led out his son to sacrifice
him, if seeing <i>yours</i> dead, you give thanks to the
God of mercy. How is such a man less than Abraham?
He did not see <i>his</i> son lying dead, but only
expected it; so that if he carries off the palm for his
readiness to sacrifice, and for putting out his hand
to seize the knife, he is surpassed by the fact of <i>your</i>
son being actually a corpse before your eyes. And,
besides, the inward consciousness of his good deed
bore him up with consolation, that heroic action
being produced by his own fortitude, and the listening
to the voice from above increased his readiness;
in this case there is nothing of this kind. Thus it
requires a most steadfast soul in the man who looks
upon his only son, brought up in wealth and giving
much promise, lying stretched across the threshold,
in order to bear it meekly. He who can do this has
overcome the tempest of natural emotion, and is able
to speak tearlessly those words of Job: <i>The Lord has
given, the Lord has taken away</i>; he will take his place
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
even with Abraham, and be proclaimed with Job
for this one word alone. And if you put a stop
to the wailing of women and break up the bands
of weepers, and lead them to the voice of praise,
numberless rewards will follow both from above
and below; men will be in admiration, angels will
applaud, God will be your crown.</p>

<p><i>Blessed are ye when men reproach you, and pursue you,
and say every evil thing against you, lying. Rejoice and
be glad, because your reward is very great in heaven; for
this is what their fathers did to the prophets.</i> And
again, Paul, wishing to encourage the Macedonians,
said: <i>You, brethren, are become the imitators of the
churches of God in Judea, because you have suffered from
your own countrymen the same things as they suffered
from the Jews.</i> And again, exhorting the Hebrews in
the same way, he enumerates all the just; those
who were in furnaces, in water, in deserts, in mountains,
in caves, in hunger, those living in anguish;
as a community of suffering is in itself some consolation
to its victims. And listen again to Paul
urging the same thing when speaking of the resurrection:
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
<i>If as a man I fought with the wild beasts at
Ephesus, what do I gain by it if the dead are not to rise
again?</i> And again: If we hope in Christ in this life
only, we are more miserable than all men. We
suffer a thousand evils according to this world, he
says; if then we may hope for no other life, what
can be more wretched than we? Whence it is clear
that our lives do not end here, and this is evident
from temptations, for God would never allow those
who have suffered so much and so greatly, and have
passed their whole lives in temptations and numberless
dangers, not to be rewarded with gifts much
greater. And if this be the case, it is evident that
He has prepared another life which is happier and
more glorious, in which He means to crown and to
proclaim the champions of piety in the face of the
whole world. Therefore, when you see a just man
spending this present life in great trouble, when you
see him ill-treated, in sickness, poverty, and enduring
all sorts of misfortunes, say to yourself, that if there
were no resurrection and no judgment, God would
not allow him to leave this world after suffering so
many evils and enjoying no good. Hence it is
evident that He holds in reserve for them another
life far pleasanter and higher than this. If this
were not the case He would not allow so many
sinners to feast in this life, nor so many just to be in
a sea of troubles. But since there <i>is</i> another life, in
which He designs to give to every man according to
his deserts, whether they be those of wickedness or
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
those of goodness, He suffers the one to be persecuted
and the other to enjoy himself. I will endeavour to
prove another reason (why suffering is tolerated)
from the Scriptures. And what is it? That we
who are called to the same virtue may not say that
<i>they</i> had a different nature to ours and were not men.
So in speaking of the great Elias it is said that Elias
was a man of like feelings to ourselves. Do you see
that he is shown to be a man like to us from similarity
of feelings? And again: <i>For I am a man of like
nature to yourselves</i>. This is a pledge of similarity.
Clearly He is teaching you here the lesson that He
makes us happy in the right way. When you hear
Paul saying, <i>Up to the present time we are in hunger, and
thirst, and nakedness, and we are chastised, and homeless,
and weary</i>; and again: <i>that the Lord chastises the one
He loves, and scourges every son He receives</i>, it is evident
that we should exalt not those who are enjoying rest,
but those who are tried and afflicted for God, and
that we should emulate those who live holily, and
care for piety. So spoke the prophet: <i>Their right hand
is the right hand of iniquity. Their daughters decked out,
adorned round about after the similitude of a temple. Their
store-houses full, flowing out of this into that. Their sheep
fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth; their
oxen fat. There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying
out in their streets. They have called the people happy
that hath these things.</i> What do you say, O prophet?
<i>Happy</i>, he says, <i>is that people whose God is the Lord</i>. I
call blessed, not the man who abounds in money, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
him who lives for piety, even if he suffer a thousand
evils. And if we ought to speak of another<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> reason, I
should say that tribulation increases the worth of the
tried. <i>Tribulation worketh patience, and patience probation,
probation hope, and hope is not shamed</i>: see you how
the probation produced by tribulation makes us
hopeful concerning the future, and how remaining in
temptations puts us in good hope of what is to come?
Therefore, I said, not unadvisedly, that tribulations
themselves strengthen the resurrection in our hearts,
and make those who are tried better. For as, he
says, gold is tried in the fire, so is an acceptable man
in the fire of humiliation. There is yet another<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
reason. What is this? One which I have often
spoken of already: that, if we have any stains, we
may put them off in this world. The Patriarch
clearly said to the rich man that Lazarus had received
his bad things, and was therefore consoled.
And, added to this, we may find another reason.
What is it? The strengthening of our crowns and
rewards, for the more searching the tribulation, the
greater will be the rewards, or, rather, they will far
surpass the comparison. <i>The sufferings of this time
are not worthy to be compared to the glory to come, which
shall be revealed in us.</i> Having, then, all these reasons
to give for the affliction of the saints, let us not
be cast down in temptations, nor distressed, nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
harassed, but let us instruct our own souls, and
teach these things to others. Even if you see a
man leading a good life, practising asceticism,
pleasing God, and he be suffering a thousand evils,
be not scandalised, O beloved. Again, if you see some
one overthrown who is engaged in spiritual works
and about to complete something useful, be not
troubled. For I have often heard many men remark
upon it in this way: &lsquo;So and so,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;went
to a shrine, taking all his money to the poor, and
he was shipwrecked, and lost everything; another,
again, did the same and fell among thieves, and
barely escaping with his life, he got away in nakedness&rsquo;.
What should we say? That none of these
things need trouble us. For if he <i>did</i> perish by
shipwreck, the fruit of justice is perfect above: he
had done his part, he had put together his possessions,
given them up, and taking them, had set out.
He had begun his journey, but the shipwreck was
not of his own making. Why, then, did God allow
it? That it might prove him. Still the poor were
deprived of their money, you say: you do not care
for the poor as God their maker does. If they were
indeed deprived of this money, He is able to offer
them an opportunity of a much greater treasure.</p>
<p>Therefore, do not let us call Him to account for
what has happened, but glorify Him in all things.
For not by chance, or in vain, does He allow such
things often to come about, nor does He despise
those who are to enjoy solace from money, but instead
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
of this He puts another means of support in
their way, and, besides the trial, gives the shipwrecked
man a greater reward. Indeed, giving
thanks to God in trials of this kind is much higher
than alms, for we do not give by alms alone, but if we
bear bravely the losses inflicted by others, we shall
gain immense fruit from it. In order to prove this
to you I will make it clear to you from what happened
to Job that patience is better than alms-giving.
When Job was rich, he opened his house to the poor
and gave away all that he possessed, but he was not
so magnificent at the time he was opening his house
to the needy, as when he heard unmoved that it had
fallen to the ground: he was not so renowned when
he covered the naked with the fleece of his sheep as
when, hearing that fire had broken out and consumed
all his cattle, he gave thanks. <i>Then</i> he was kind,
now he became mortified: <i>then</i> he had compassion
on the poor, now he gave thanks to his Lord. Nor
did he say to himself: &lsquo;What is the meaning of this?
The sheep, from which thousands of poor were fed,
are destroyed: for if <i>I</i> was unworthy to enjoy this
abundance, I should have been spared, at least, for
the sake of those who shared it.&rsquo; He neither said
nor thought anything of the sort, but he knew that
God was ordering it all for the best. And to show
you that he beat the devil more effectually by giving
thanks when despoiled than by showing mercy
when rich, consider that, at the time of his wealth,
the devil had some reason, even if falsely, for saying,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
<i>Does Job worship Thee for nothing?</i> Now when God
took away everything, and stripped him completely,
and Job kept his good-will towards God, then was
that shameless mouth stopped, and he had nothing
more to say: that just man was more glorious than
before. To bear with fortitude and thanksgiving
the being despoiled is a much greater thing than for
a rich man to give alms, as has been shown in the
case of this just man. Then his kindness to his
fellow-man was overflowing, now he proved his exceeding
love for God. I insist on this, not without
reason, but because many men by frequent alms
have supported widows, and then been deprived of
their substance. Others have lost everything through
a fire breaking out; others have encountered shipwreck;
others through slanderings and abuse have,
after generous alms-giving, fallen into the extreme of
poverty, and into weakness and disease, and have
been helped by no one in any way. In order, therefore,
that we should not say, as many often do, &lsquo;No
man knows anything,&rsquo; what I have said will suffice
to put an end to this difficulty. &lsquo;So and so, who
gave so much in alms,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;lost everything.&rsquo;
And what if he did? For, if he give thanks for this
great loss of his, he will propitiate God&rsquo;s good-will
the more, and reap not double riches, as Job did,
but the hundred-fold in eternal life. If he <i>does</i>
suffer here, the very fact of his bearing it all bravely
will increase his reward. God, in calling him to
greater trials and struggles, allowed him to fall from
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
abundance into poverty. Has fire perchance often
broken out in your house and destroyed your substance?
Remember what happened to Job, give
thanks to the Lord, Who was able to stop it and did
not stop it, and you will receive a reward as great as
if you had poured forth all those things into the hands
of the poor. Or, are you living in poverty and hunger,
and a thousand dangers? Call to mind Lazarus,
who was hard pressed by sickness, and poverty, and
solitude, and numberless things of the kind, and all
this after so much goodness; call to mind the
Apostles, who passed their lives in hunger and
thirst and nakedness; and the prophets, and
patriarchs, and just, and you will find them one and
all, not amongst the rich, not amongst those who
feast, but amongst those suffering hunger and
affliction and anguish.</p>
<p>Pondering on these things, give thanks to God for
the share He has allotted to you, not in hatred, but in
tender love, since He would not have allowed those
men to suffer evils so great, if He had not loved them
dearly, because He made them more illustrious
through these evils. No good is so great as thanksgiving,
as nothing is worse than blasphemy. Let
us not be astonished that, when we are paying much
attention to spiritual things, we suffer a great deal.
It is as with thieves, who do not break into places
where mud and chaff and reeds are, but where gold
and silver are, and are ever on the watch. Thus the
devil gives his special attention to those who are
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
taken up with spiritual things. Snares are numerous
where goodness exists, and envy is to be found
where there is alms-giving. But we have one great
weapon by which we may resist all these machinations,
the giving thanks to God in all things. Tell
me, did not Abel, who reserved the first-fruits for
God, fall by his brother&rsquo;s hand? Yet God allowed
it, not hating the man who had honoured him, but
loving him much, and adding to the crown of Abel&rsquo;s
beautiful sacrifice the further crown of martyrdom.
Moses wished to succour some one who had been
wronged, and he confronted the greatest dangers
on this account, and fled from his country, and God
allowed it, to teach you what the patience of the
saints is. If, knowing beforehand that we should
suffer no evil, we were thus to give ourselves up to
spiritual things, we should not appear to be doing a
great thing, possessing this pledge of security. Now,
it so happens that those who do this are chiefly admirable
because, foreseeing dangers, and penalties,
and deaths, and a thousand evils, they have still
neither desisted from their good deeds nor grown
faint-hearted through fear of the terrors to come.
As the three children said, <i>There is a God in heaven
Who can deliver us, and even if He do not, know, O king,
that we do not worship thy gods, and do not adore the
golden statue which thou hast set up</i>, so when you are
about to do something for God, expect many dangers,
many penalties, many deaths, and wonder not nor
fear at them. <i>Son</i>, he says, <i>when thou comest to serve</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
<i>God, prepare thy soul for temptation</i>. For no one who
has chosen a hand-to-hand fight may expect to bear
off the crown without wounds. And you who are to
wrestle with the devil in every possible way, live not
a life of ease and luxury. Your rewards and promises
are not here, but God promises you all glory
in the world to come. When, therefore, either you
yourself do a good action and reap contrary effects,
or you see another enduring them, rejoice and be
glad, for the deed becomes a source of greater reward
to you; only be not cast down, do not lose your
fervour, grow not faint-hearted, but rather go on
your way with greater readiness. Since the Apostles,
also, were scourged and stoned and perpetually in
prison for what they preached, not only after their
liberation from dangers, but in the very midst of
them, they announced the tidings with all the more
willingness. We may see Paul catechising and instructing
even in prison, even in his chains, and
again before the tribunal, and in the shipwreck, and
the storm, and in a thousand dangers. Do you also
emulate these saints, and, as long as you can, hold to
good works. Even if you see the devil assailing you
on a thousand sides, never turn away. In distributing
your money, you may perhaps have suffered
shipwreck, yet Paul, who was more precious than
any money, in preaching the word, went to Rome,
suffered shipwreck, and endured numberless evils.
And this he clearly says in the words: <i>We have often
wished to come to you, but Satan has prevented us</i>. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
God allowed it by an abundant manifestation of His
power, showing that, in spite of the devil&rsquo;s making and
unmaking in a thousand ways, the Gospel was by no
means lessened or impeded thereby. So Paul gave
thanks to God in everything, knowing that God was
proving him by these things; and he showed his
burning zeal everywhere by allowing no obstacle to
stand in his way. Now, the more we meet with
failure, the greater will be our hold of spiritual
works; and do not let us say, &lsquo;Why did God allow
there to be impediments?&rsquo; He allowed them that He
may prove your zeal the more to the multitude, and
your true love. For lovers are remarkable for never
departing from the good pleasure of the beloved one.
He who is remiss and luxurious is prostrated by the
first touch of tribulation; but the fervent and watchful
man, even if he be impeded in a thousand ways,
sets himself the more to work at God&rsquo;s business,
doing his part perfectly, and giving thanks in every
thing. This let us also do. Thanksgiving is an immense
treasure, great riches, an inexhaustible good,
a strong weapon. Blasphemy has a present penalty,
and causes our destruction over and above what we
have suffered. Have you lost money? If you have
given thanks, you have gained your soul and won
greater riches for yourself, and propitiated God the
more; but, if you have blasphemed, you have destroyed
your own salvation without gaining any of
those things, and have slain your own soul.</p>

<h3 id="c38"><span class="sc">The Folly of the Cross.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, xiv., vol. ii., p. 36.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Showing the power of the Cross, St. Paul says:
<i>The Jews too ask for signs, and the Greeks seek after
wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, a scandal to the
Jews, a folly to the Gentiles, but to those who are called,
both Jews and Gentiles, Christ the power of God and the
wisdom of God</i>. There is a deep meaning in these
words. For he wishes to say how God conquered
by contraries, and that the promulgation of the
Gospel does not come from man. What he says
amounts to this. When we say to the Jews, &lsquo;Believe,&rsquo;
they reply, &lsquo;Raise up the dead, cure those who are
possessed, show us signs&rsquo;. How do we answer these
things? By saying, that He Whom we preach was
crucified and died. This was sufficient not only not
to move those who did not wish to be moved, but
also to repulse those who had the will; yet still He
is not repulsed, but draws men after Him, and conquers
and gets the better of them. Again, the
Gentiles demand of us eloquent discourses and
elaborate reasonings, and we reply to them also by
preaching the Cross, and that which seems to be
weakness to the Jews, the Gentiles consider folly.
Now, when we not only do not offer them what they
ask for, but the very contrary, for the Cross not only
does not seem to be a sign tested, according to
human reason, but the destruction of signs: not
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
only not a manifestation of power, but a proof of
weakness: not only not an embodiment of wisdom,
but a personification of folly; when, then, those who
look for signs and wisdom not only do not receive
what they seek, but listen to things which are the
exact contrary of their desires, and, furthermore, are
persuaded by them, is not the power of Him Who is
preached beyond words? It is as if some one were
to show those who are tossed on the waves and
longing for harbour, not the land, but a more angry
sea, would he induce them to follow him? Or if a
physician were to tell a man broken by pain and
desiring remedies that he will restore health, not by
medicine but by again using the knife, would his
patient yield himself to his guidance? This implies
very great power. So the Apostles made their way
not only by signs, but by a line of action seemingly
in opposition with signs, as Christ had done in the
case of the blind man. For wishing to cure him, He
used a course which increased the affliction, as He
put clay upon his eyes. Just, then, as He cured the
blind man by putting clay upon him, so he drew the
world to Himself through the Cross, which indeed
was an increase, not a removal of scandal. So He
acted in the Creation, preparing contraries by contraries.
He built up with sand the limits of the sea,
curbing the strong with the weak; He placed the
earth upon the water, causing that which was hard
and firm to be upborne by flowing and liquid matter.
Again, through the prophets He made iron float with
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
a little wood. Thus He drew the world after Himself
through His Cross. For as water supports the
earth, so the Cross supports the world. Therefore
it is a great proof of power and wisdom to persuade
by contraries. And if the Cross seems to be a subject
of scandal, still not only it does <i>not</i> scandalise, but it
draws to itself. St. Paul had all these things in his
mind and was struck with astonishment when he
said that <i>the folly of God is wiser than man, and
the weakness of God is stronger than man</i>, applying
this folly and this weakness to the Cross, not that
it was really foolish and weak but that it seemed so:
for he answers them according to <i>their</i> estimate.
That, in fact, which philosophers had been unable to
do by their reasonings was effected by this apparent
folly. Now who was the wiser? He Who persuaded
many, or he who persuaded a few&mdash;or rather
no one? He Who convinced man of the greatest
things, or he who used his powers of persuasion
about things which do not exist at all? How Plato
and his school laboured about the line, the angle,
and the point, and about even numbers and odd
numbers, and about their being equal and unequal,
discoursing to us about such like cobwebs, for such
things are less profitable to our life than even cobwebs,
and so helping us neither much nor little, he
came to the end of his life.</p>
<p>How he wearied himself to show that the spirit is
immortal, and did he not die without making any
clear statement or convincing a single man amongst
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
his disciples? But it was through unlearned men
that the Cross brought conviction, and drew the
world to itself. It spoke to men, not of chance
things, but of God, and of piety in the truth, of
the Gospel polity, of future judgment, and it made
uncouth men and unlearned men philosophers.</p>
<p>This is how the folly of God is wiser than man,
and His weakness stronger. How is it stronger?
It is stronger in that it spread over the whole earth
and seized all men by force, and whereas thousands
and thousands did their utmost to stamp out the
name of the Crucified One, just the contrary came
to pass. For this name took root and was propagated
all the more, whereas <i>they</i> were destroyed
and consumed, and living men fighting a dead One,
gained not a stroke. Consequently when a heathen
tells me that I am a fool, he proves that he himself
is doubly one; inasmuch as considered by him to be
a fool, I appear wiser than the wise; and when he
calls me weak, he shows himself to be weaker. For
publicans and fishermen set up those very things by
the goodness of God which philosophers, and orators,
and despots, and the whole world vainly striving
with all its might could not even devise.</p>
<p>What, indeed, has the Cross not introduced? The
belief concerning the immortality of the soul, and the
resurrection of the body, the despising of present
things, the desire of eternal. And it made angels
out of men, who practise everywhere the philosophy
of all endurance. But amongst heathens, too, you
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
say, &lsquo;There have been many who have despised
death&rsquo;. Tell me who they are. Do you allude perchance
to the drinker of hemlock? But, if you like,
I will show you thousands of such men in the
Church. For if, when a persecution came, all men
could get off by taking hemlock, they would all have
been more illustrious than he was. Besides, he
drained the cup, not being free to drink or not to
drink: willing or unwilling, he had to suffer, which
was not courage, but necessity. Thieves and
murderers under sentence of their judges have suffered
harder things. It is just the very contrary
amongst us; for the martyrs endured, not in spite of
themselves, but willingly, and having it in their power
not to suffer, showed forth a fortitude beyond all
proof. Therefore it is not surprising if Socrates drank
hemlock, both because he could not do otherwise,
and because he had reached extreme old age, for he
said that he was seventy years old when he despised
life, if this be indeed despising it; <i>I</i> should not say
so, nor would anyone else. But show me a man
rejoicing in torments for his belief, as I can show
<i>you</i> thousands all over the world. Who bore
bravely the tearing out of his nails, the racking of
his joints, the hacking asunder of his members, one
after the other, the stretching upon a gridiron, or
plunging into a caldron? Show me this. For death
by hemlock is equivalent to slumbering quietly away,
as it is said to be an end which is sweeter than sleep.
And if certain men have even endured torments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
they have forfeited the praise due to them by dying
for criminal causes: some for betraying secret things,
others for aiming at domination, others for being
taken in the most shameful deeds; others, again,
either vainly or foolishly, without any cause, have
destroyed themselves. But it is not so with us.
And this is why their deeds have been hushed in
silence, whilst ours are flowering and increasing day
by day. This was in Paul&rsquo;s mind when he said:
&lsquo;The weakness of God is stronger than all men put
together&rsquo;. For the divinity that was in the tidings
is clear from this. How, indeed, was it that twelve
unlettered men attempted things of this importance,
twelve men, whose life was spent on seas and rivers
and in deserts, who scarcely entered city or marketplace?
How did they manage to set themselves in
battle array over the whole world? The recorder of
their deeds shows them to have been faint-hearted
and unmanly, and himself to have no desire to conceal
their shortcomings, which were themselves the
greatest proof of the truth. Now, what does he say
about them? That when Christ was taken, after
seeing Him work countless wonders, some fled, and
the one who remained, the chief of all, denied Him.
How was it, then, that those who, whilst Christ
lived, could not endure Jewish anger, should have
been able to range themselves against the whole
earth after He was dead and buried, if, as heathens
say, He did not rise from the dead, nor have any
communication with them, nor infuse courage into
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
them? Would they not have said to themselves,
&lsquo;How is this? He was not powerful enough to
save Himself, and will He help us? He did not
help Himself whilst alive, and will He, now that He
is dead, put out His hand to us? In life He did not
gain over even one people, and shall we persuade the
whole world by speaking His name?&rsquo; And, indeed,
how would it be reasonable not only to do these
things, but even to conceive the doing? Whence it
is evident that if they had not seen His resurrection,
and had not witnessed a very great proof of His
power, they would not have made such a venture.
For if they had, indeed, numberless friends, would
they not have made enemies of them all by disturbing
ancient customs and removing ancestral landmarks?
Now, they had all for enemies both at
home and abroad. But if they had been in universal
veneration on account of outward gifts, would not
all men have detested them for introducing a new
manner of life? Seeing, however, that they were
without all these things, this in itself would have
been enough to make them hated and despised by
all.</p>

<h3 id="c39"><span class="sc">The Abode of the Humble.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lxxii., vol. ii., p. 344.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>He who humbleth himself shall be exalted.</i> Where
shall we find this humility? Would you like to go
once more to the abode of goodness, to the tents of
the blessed, I mean, to the mountains and forests?
For it is there that we shall see this perfection
of humility. They are men, some famous for outward
position, some for wealth, who humble themselves
in every particular, in their food, in their
dwelling, in their servants, and so in all their life
they are writing the word <i>humility</i> as if with pen
and ink. Just as smart dressing and a fine house
and a large establishment are incentives to vainglory,
which thrust men into it, often in spite of
themselves, all these things are cut off in the desert.
Those men light their own fire, hew their wood, do
their own cooking, and themselves wait upon guests.
Insult is neither given nor taken, no man is ruled,
no man rules, but all are ministering. Each man
washes the stranger&rsquo;s feet, and there is much contention
as to who shall do it. This he does, not
seeking to find out who the stranger is, whether a
slave or a free man; in each case he carries out
this service. No man is either great or small. Is
there confusion then? God forbid, it is rather the
perfection of harmony. If, indeed, a man there be
of small account, he who is great does not regard
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
it, but deems himself inferior, and so becomes
greater.</p>
<p>Both servers and served eat at one and the same
table, have the same food, the same clothes, the same
lodging, the same rule of life. He is great there who
is eager over a lowly task. Mine and thine do not
exist, and the thing itself, the cause of endless strife,
has been banished. And why do you wonder that
there is one rule, one table, and one dress for all,
where there is one spirit in all, not according to the
body only (for this is the case with all men), but according
to charity? For how could charity ever be set
against itself? Neither poverty nor riches are to be
found there, neither fame nor disgrace. How, then,
could folly or vainglory creep in? Some are great,
some are little amongst the number according to a
moral reckoning, but as I was saying, no one takes
note of it. The weak man does not grieve as being
despised, for there is no one to despise him. Even
should anyone insult another, this is their principal
training, bearing contempt and contumely and shabby
treatment both in word and act; they live with
the lowly and the maimed, for these are the guests
of their repasts, and thus they are worthy of heaven.
One dresses sores, another leads the blind, another
supports the lame. There are neither flatterers nor
parasites, or rather they do not even apprehend
what flattery is. How, then, could they ever be
puffed up? For a great equality reigns among them,
consequently the contentedness produced by goodness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
In this way the most wretched are better
taught than by being obliged to give them the first
places. Just as a meek man schools an impetuous
man to lowliness, so does a man who makes no
account of reputation, but despises it, teach the
ambitious. This they do lavishly, for, in proportion
as we fight over the first places, do they wrestle not
to have them, but to be hindered; and their burning
zeal is, not who shall be honoured, but who shall
not be honoured. Moreover, their very works incline
them to moderation, and do not tolerate vanity. For,
tell me, how can a man who is tilling and watering
and planting the earth, or plaiting baskets, or
weaving a sack, or doing any other manual labour,
ever think great things of himself? Who, that is
living in poverty, and struggling with hunger, will be
sick with this complaint? No man. Therefore their
lowliness is well contented. And just as moderation
is difficult here, through the crowd of flatterers and
admirers, so is it perfectly easy <i>there</i>. They have
only the desert before them: they see birds flying,
and the breeze through the trees, and the soft wind
blowing, and streams flowing through ravines. How,
then, could a man living in so great a solitude be
puffed up? Neither can <i>we</i> find any excuse, that,
being in the thick of the fight, we think great things
of ourselves. For Abraham, when in company of
the Chanan&aelig;ns, said, <i>I am dust and ashes</i>, and
David, in the din of arms, <i>I am a worm and no man</i>,
and the Apostle in the midst of the world, <i>I am not</i>

<i>worthy to be called an apostle</i>. Therefore, what shall
we have to say for ourselves, if, even with these
great examples before us, we are not sober? As <i>they</i>
are worthy of a thousand crowns for being the first
to walk upon the path of goodness, so do we deserve
as many chastisements for not arriving at a like zeal,
neither for the example of those who have departed
hence and lie in their sepulchres, nor for the living
who are wonderful through their deeds. What
could you allege for not being converted? Are you
unlettered, and have you not read the epitaphs so as
to know the goodness of those men of old? This is
indeed the chief point of accusation, the church
being ever open, not to go in and partake of those
pure waters. Besides, if you did not know the dead
through their epitaphs, you should have had these
living men before your eyes. &lsquo;But if there was no
one to point them out to us?&rsquo; Come with me and I
will show you the dwelling-places of these holy ones:
come and learn a useful lesson from them. They are
shining lights throughout the world, they surround
cities like strong walls. They have taken possession
of deserts in order to teach you to look down upon
worldly agitations. They, then, in this strength of
theirs, are able to enjoy peace in the midst of the
tempest: you, who are tossed about on all sides,
should be at rest, and have a short breathing time
from the ever rolling waves.</p>

<h3 id="c40"><span class="sc">The Prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on Epistle to the Ephesians</i>, viii., vol. iv., p. 175.)</h3>
<p>It is the virtue of teachers to seek not honour nor
glory from their disciples, but their salvation, and to
do all things unto that end; for he who seeks the
former would be a tyrant, not a teacher. It was not
for your greater personal glorification that God set
you over them, but that your business should be
forgotten whilst theirs is strengthened. This is a
teacher&rsquo;s part; this was what blessed Paul did, who
was removed from vanity and considered himself as
one of the multitude, or rather as the least of all.
Thus he calls himself their slave, and generally
speaks in the attitude of a suppliant. Look at him,
at least in this instance, writing nothing imperiously,
nothing authoritatively, but mild, conciliating words.
<i>I, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk
worthy of the vocation in which you are called</i>, he says.
Tell me, what do you beseech, O Paul? That you
may get something for yourself? &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; he
answers, &lsquo;but that I may save others.&rsquo; Yet they who
beseech do it for what concerns themselves. &lsquo;And
this does concern me,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;as I have written
distinctly in another place: <i>Now we live, if you stand
in the Lord</i>.&rsquo; He was always most eager for the
salvation of his disciples. <i>I, the prisoner in the Lord.</i>
Great and wonderful dignity, surpassing consulships,
and kingdoms, and all things else. This he wrote
also to Philemon, saying: <i>As Paul, an old man, and</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
<i>now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ</i>. Nothing is so
glorious as a chain for Christ&rsquo;s sake, as the fetters
which hang round those hallowed hands. Better
than being an apostle, or a teacher, or an evangelist,
is it to be a prisoner for Christ&rsquo;s sake. If there be a
lover of Christ, he will know what I
say;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> if any
man be foolish and on fire for his Lord, he understands
the power of chains, he would choose to be a
prisoner for Christ rather than to dwell in paradise.
Paul has shown us those hands of his more glittering
than gold or than any royal crown. A band of
precious stones does not ennoble a head as iron
chains for Christ&rsquo;s sake. <i>His</i> prison was more
glorious than kingly palaces, or than heaven itself.
Why do I say &lsquo;than palaces&rsquo;? That place contained
Christ&rsquo;s prisoner. A lover of Christ knows what
this privilege is, he is acquainted with this virtue,
he knows what a gain the being in chains for His
sake has been to the human race. More glorious
far than sitting on His right hand, more solemn
than sitting on one of the twelve thrones, is the being
imprisoned for His sake. And why do I speak of
human things? I shame to put riches and golden
ornament in comparison with those chains, but with
regard to those great ones, if their deed had no reward,
this alone is a great reward and a powerful antidote,
the suffering these evils on account of the Beloved.
Lovers, I say not of God but of man, know the proverb
which speaks of those who take pleasure rather
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
in suffering evils from the loved ones than in being
honoured by them. This is seen only in the case of
the holy band: I mean the Apostles. Listen to what
blessed Luke says: <i>They went from the council rejoicing
that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for His
Name</i>. Now to others it seems ridiculous that dishonour
should be accounted honour and a joy, but
to those who follow Christ this desire is held to be
most blessed of all. If anyone would give me all
heaven or those chains, I would choose the chains.
If anyone were to place me with the angels above
or with Paul in chains, I would choose his prison.
If anyone were to make me one of those heavenly
Powers or Thrones, or a prisoner as Paul was, I
would choose to be a prisoner. Nothing is more
blessed than those chains. Would that I could now
be in those regions; for it is said that the chains are
preserved, as well they may be, and I am in admiration
of those men full of desire for Christ; would
that I could see those chains, which devils have
feared and trembled at, which angels reverence.
Nothing is better than suffering some adversity
for the sake of Christ. I deem Paul blessed not
so much because he was ravished into paradise as
for being thrown into prison. I call him blessed
not so much because he heard ineffable words as for
enduring chains. I hold him blessed not so much
for being carried into the third heaven as for his
chains. That these were greater than those things,
understand what he himself thought of them. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
did not say, &lsquo;I, who have heard mysterious words,
beseech you,&rsquo; but what? <i>I, the prisoner in the Lord,
beseech you.</i> And if he did not use the expression in
all his epistles, it is not astonishing, for he was not
always in chains, only at certain times. I would
choose rather to suffer adversity for Christ than to
be honoured by Christ. This is true honour and
glory, higher than any other. If he became a
servant for my sake and divested Himself of His
praise, nor deemed that He was glorified except in
being crucified for me, what ought I not to suffer?
Listen to Him as He says, <i>Glorify Me, O Father</i>.
What sayest Thou, Lord? Thou art led to the cross
between thieves and malefactors, to suffer the most
shameful death; Thou art to be spit upon and struck,
and this Thou callest glory? &lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; He answers, &lsquo;I
suffer these things for those whom I love, and account
them a glory indeed.&rsquo; If He Who loves the
wretched and miserable calls this glory, if He finds
His glory, not in being on His Father&rsquo;s throne, nor
in honour, but in being dishonoured, and prefers it,
how much more am <i>I</i> bound to hold these things a
glory! O happy chains, O blessed hands which those
chains adorned! Those hands of Paul&rsquo;s which
raised up the lame man in Lystra and made him
walk were less honourable than when covered with
chains. If I had been living in those days, it is then
that I would have embraced them and placed them
on my eyes; I would not have ceased caressing the
hands which had been found worthy to wear chains
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
for my Lord&rsquo;s sake. Do you wonder at Paul because
the serpent fastened upon his hand and did no
harm? Wonder not: the serpent reverenced the
chains, and so did the ocean, for then he was in
fetters. If anyone were to give me now the power
of raising the dead I would not have it, but I would
have those chains. If I were free from the cares of
the Church, and were sound in body, I would go
that long journey only to look at those chains, to
see the prison in which he was bound. Although
amongst his wonderful deeds there are many signs
everywhere, they are not so enviable as the marks
of Christ. And in the Scripture he does not encourage
me so much by wonder-working as he does
when he is suffering persecution, being scourged, and
dragged away. <i>So that</i>, he says, <i>they brought handkerchiefs
and aprons from his body to the sick</i>. These
were truly wonders, but not so great as those others:
<i>They scourged him and laid many stripes upon him, they
cast them into prison</i>; and again: <i>They gave praise to
God in their chains</i>; and again: <i>They stoned him and
drew him out of the city, thinking him to be dead</i>. Would
you know what a privilege it is for the body of a servant
to wear an iron chain for Christ&rsquo;s sake? Then
listen to Christ&rsquo;s words: <i>Blessed are ye</i>. Why blessed,
O Lord? When you raise the dead? No, not for
this. When you cure the blind? Not at all. Then
why? <i>When they shall reproach you, and pursue you,
and say every evil against you, lying, for My sake.</i> And
if evil report makes men so blessed, what will suffering
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
evil not do for them? Listen to that holy one
who says this in another place: <i>For the rest a crown of
justice awaits me</i>. Yet the chains are brighter than
this crown; they will make me worthy of it, he says,
and I value nothing so much. Suffering for Christ&rsquo;s
sake is a perpetual remedy to me. May it be given
to me to utter those words, <i>I make up in my flesh
what is wanting to the sufferings of Christ</i>: and I shall
want nothing more.</p>

<h3 id="c41"><span class="sc">The Seed not vivified unless it dies.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, xli., vol. ii., p. 517.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>But some one asks, how are the dead to be raised to life?
With what sort of body will they come? Senseless man,
that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.</i>
Whereas the Apostle is everywhere so gentle and
humble, he makes use of stronger language in this
place on account of the adversaries&rsquo; unreasonableness.
Nor is this enough but he adds arguments and examples,
and in this way gets the better even of the
most contentious. He had already said: <i>Whereas
by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
from the dead</i>; and now he dissipates an opinion
prevalent amongst heathens. And consider again
how he cuts away that which is most plausible about
it. He did not say, &lsquo;<i>you</i> ask,&rsquo; but made the adversary
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
indefinite, that, using strong language with
effect, he might not unduly crush his hearers. He
stated two difficulties: the manner of the resurrection
and the quality of bodies. And indeed they were in
doubt concerning both points by their words: &lsquo;How
can that which is dissolved rise again?&rsquo; and, &lsquo;With
what sort of body will they come?&rsquo; How, <i>with
what sort of body</i>? Will it be like this corruptible
mortal body, or like some other? Then, to show
that they are not seeking to clear up doubtful
points but to dispute what is indisputable, he uses
still stronger language, saying, <i>Foolish man, that which
thou sowest is not vivified unless it dieth</i>.</p>
<p>This is also our way of answering those who call
in question what is indisputable. Why, for instance,
does he not at once take refuge in the power of God?
Because he is talking to unbelievers. Whenever he
has to deal with believers he is in no great need of
arguments. For instance, saying in another place
that <i>He shall transform the body of your humility
into becoming conformed to the body of His glory</i>, and
showing forth something further than the resurrection,
he made use of no examples, but, instead of
any proof, brought forward the power of God, adding,
<i>according to the efficacy of His power and to bring all
things into subjection to Him</i>. Here, however, he sets
arguments in motion. For since he provided this
one from Scripture, he used the same with authority
against those who did not believe in the Scriptures,
and said: <i>Foolish man, that which thou sowest</i>; that
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
is, you see from what you yourself do day after day
the proof of these things, and do you still doubt?
This is why I call you foolish, that you ignore what
happens every day to yourself, and that whereas <i>you</i>
can work a resurrection, you doubt concerning God;
therefore he said most emphatically: <i>That which thou
sowest</i>; you, that is, who are a mortal and corruptible
man.</p>
<p>And see how the words he uses bring home the
point in question. <i>It is not vivified</i>, he says, <i>unless it
dieth</i>. Passing over the terms which are proper to
seeds, such as the sprouting and growth and rotting
and withering, he takes those points which correspond
to our flesh, the &lsquo;vivifying&rsquo; and &lsquo;death,&rsquo; which
belong properly not to seeds but to bodies. And he
does not say that it is vivified after dying, but what
is more, that it is quickened <i>because</i> it has died.
You see how, as I am always saying, he brings his
argument as a proof against itself. That which they
made out as conclusive against the resurrection <i>he</i>
makes an earnest of it, for they said, &lsquo;He will not
rise because he is dead&rsquo;. Now, how can you meet
this? If, indeed, he had not died, neither would he
rise again, and <i>because</i> he has died, therefore he rises
again. In the same way Christ points this out still
more clearly, saying: <i>If the grain of wheat, falling
into the earth, doth not die, it remaineth alone, but
if it dieth, it beareth much fruit</i>; so here, in illustrating
this example, Paul does not say that it does
not live, but that it is not &lsquo;quickened,&rsquo; making again
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
the power of God his theme, and showing that it is
He Who does all, not the properties of the soil.
And why did he not at once speak of something more
personal&mdash;I mean of human seed? For our coming
into the world also begins in corruption just as that
of the corn does. It was because it was still stronger
in our case than in the latter. What he wants is
something quite perishable: the corn was partially so,
and that is why he introduced it. Besides, the
human seed proceeds from a living person, and falls
into a living womb, but here the seed is cast into the
earth, not into a living body, and becomes dissolved
in it, just as in the case of the mortal body. Thus
the example was the more pertinent.</p>
<p><i>And the sower does not sow the body which shall be.</i>
That which has been said so far is to answer the
objection, &lsquo;How shall they rise again?&rsquo; this is
directed to the question, &lsquo;What sort of body will
they have?&rsquo; Now what is, <i>Thou sowest not the body
which shall be</i>?&mdash;not a full ear of corn, nor new grain.
For here they were not disputing the resurrection,
but the manner of the resurrection, what sort of body
the risen one should be, whether like our present
one, or more perfect and splendid, and he embraces
both points in the same example, and shows that it
is a much more perfect one. But heretics, admitting
none of these things, retort by saying that it is one
body which is sown and another which is risen.
How, then, could it be a resurrection since a
resurrection refers to something sown? What is
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
there wonderful or awful about the victory over
death, if one thing is sown and another thing rises
again? Death would not seem to be giving back
the trophy which he took. How would the illustration
be carried out in what they say? Not one
substance is sown and another raised up, but the
same substance in an improved condition. Supposing
that Christ did not resume the same body
when He became the first fruits of the risen; but according
to you He cast off His former body although
it was without sin, and took another. Whence, then,
did this other come from? The first was from the
Virgin. Whence the second? Do you see what an
unnatural argument it is? Why did He show the
marks of the nails? Was it not because He wished
to prove that the same body which was crucified had
also risen again? How does the sign of Jonas affect
him? I presume that it was not one Jonas who
was swallowed up, and another who was washed
to land again? And what were His words? <i>Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.</i>
It is plain that He <i>did</i> raise up this temple when
destroyed. Therefore, the Evangelist went on to say
that <i>He was speaking of the temple of His body</i>. Now,
what does St. Paul say? <i>Thou sowest not the body
which shall be</i>; that is, not the ear of corn, which is
the same and not the same: the same as being the
same substance, and not the same inasmuch as it is
perfected, and whereas the same substance remains,
it rises in renewed vigour. If this were not the case,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
He would not have required a resurrection at all,
unless He had meant to raise up something better.
Why, indeed, should He dissolve the house if He did
not intend to make it a more striking dwelling-place?
This, therefore, St. Paul said in answer to those who
look upon it as corruptible. Moreover, lest any
man should imagine that he means another body, he
softens the difficulty, and himself interprets it so
that his hearer should not in any way bring the
wisdom of the world to bear upon the point. What
need is there, then, of our arguments? Listen to his
interpretation of the words, <i>Thou sowest not the body
which shall be</i>, to which he added pertinently, <i>but bare
grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest</i>. That is to
say, <i>thou sowest not the body which shall be</i>: the corn,
for instance, as we look upon it, with stalk and ear,
<i>but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.
And God giveth it a body as He wills.</i> &lsquo;Granted,&rsquo; you
say, &lsquo;but in that case the work of nature comes in.&rsquo;
Tell me, what sort of nature? Here it is God Who
works everything, not nature, nor soil, nor rain.
Hence He makes this clear, and leaving earth, rain,
air, sun, and the labour of the agriculturist out of the
question, adds: <i>God giveth it a body as He willeth</i>. Seek
not, therefore, to understand or to scrutinise the why
and the how, when you hear that God&rsquo;s power and
good pleasure come into play. <i>And to each of the
seeds its own body.</i> Why then another? He gives
each his own. So that when St. Paul says, <i>Thou
sowest not the body which shall be</i>, he does not mean
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
that He raises up something else of a different substance,
but something better and more splendid:
<i>To each one of the seeds its own substance</i>.</p>

<h3 id="c42"><span class="sc">The Resurrection in Creation.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, xvii., vol. ii., p. 199.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let no man disbelieve in the Resurrection, but if
any man be in doubt, let him consider what great
and wondrous things God made out of nothing, and
receive <i>them</i> as a pledge of <i>it</i>. That, indeed, which
has already taken place is much more marvellous
and awe-inspiring. For, consider, He took the earth
and moulded it, and made man and earth which was
not before. How, then, did earth become man?
How did the earth come out of nothing? How all
those things proceeding from the earth, the endless
families of unreasoning animals, of seeds and plants,
which came forth without travail, without rains
falling upon them, with no apparent cultivation,
neither oxen nor plough nor anything else contributing
towards their production. On this account He
brought forth in the beginning, from that which was
without life and without substance, such great things,
both of the physical and animal creation, in order
that He might teach you from the first the doctrine
of the Resurrection. For this is far more difficult
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
than the Resurrection. It is not indeed an equivalent
proof of power to rekindle a smouldering flame
and to light a fire by invisible means; it is not the
same thing to restore a dilapidated house and to
build one from the foundations. In the one case, if
there was nothing else, there was material to work
from; but in the other not even that. Consequently,
He began by the more difficult thing, in order that
you might receive that which was easier. I say
<i>more difficult</i>, not that it was so to God, but according
to our manner of reasoning. For nothing is hard to
God; and just as the sculptor who makes one statue
can as easily produce a thousand, so it is as easy to
God to create a thousand endless worlds, or, rather,
as easy as it is to you to <i>think</i> of a city or countless
worlds, and indeed much more so. <i>You</i> spend a
little time upon the thought, but it is not so with
God. In the same proportion as stones are heavier
than the swiftest birds, or rather than this mind of
ours, so much is our mind removed from God&rsquo;s
swiftness of action. Have you wondered at His
power with regard to the earth? Consider again
how the heavens were made from nothing, the
countless stars, the sun and moon: none of these
things were previously in being. Again, tell me
how, after they were made, they remained in place,
and on what they rested? What was their basis,
and what is the earth&rsquo;s basis? And what comes
after the earth? What is that something? Do
you see to what a giddy height the light of your
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
reason leads you if you do not hold eagerly to the
faith and to the inscrutable power of the Creator?
If you will make a guess from human things, you
will shortly be able to give wings to your reason.
&lsquo;What human things?&rsquo; you ask. See you not what
potters do? How they remould a broken and shapeless
thing into a vessel; how melters make gold and
iron and brass out of earth? Again, how others
who manipulate glass transform sand into one compact
and transparent body? Let me mention dyers
of leather, who dress garments: they produce one
piece after the other, which they have received, with
the dye. Again, as to our own generation: is not
the seed, formless and shapeless at first, implanted
in the mother&rsquo;s womb? Whence, then, comes so
wonderful a formation of the living man? And
what about wheat? Is not a mere seed put into
the ground? And does it not rot after it has been
put there? Whence come the ear of corn and the
stalk and all the rest? Does not a small grain of
fig, which is often scattered into the earth, take root
and put forth branches and fruit? You receive each
one of these things, and do not trouble yourself about
them, but would subject God alone, Who disposes of
our bodies, to scrutiny! What can justify such a
demand?</p>
<p>These and such like things are what we say to
heathens, for I need no argument with those who
are convinced of the Scriptures. For if you were
able to understand all that He does, how would God
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
be more than a man? Indeed there are many men
whom we fail to understand. But if this happens to
us in the case of men, and we do not grasp them,
how much more are we to abstain from scrutinising
the wisdom of God and from fathoming His reasons&mdash;the
former, because He Who acts is worthy of confidence;
the latter, because the acts themselves are
above reasonings. God is not so abject as to do only
those things which <i>you</i>, in the weakness of your
reasonings, are able to encompass. For, if you cannot
grasp a mechanic&rsquo;s work, how much less that of God
the Sovereign Architect! Therefore, do not disbelieve
the Resurrection, for you will be so much the further
away from the future hope. But what clever thing
do opponents say, or rather what exceedingly foolish
thing? &lsquo;How,&rsquo; they ask, &lsquo;when the body has been
mixed with earth, and become earth, and it again
has been changed into something else, can it rise
again?&rsquo; This seems to <i>you</i> to be impracticable, but
not so to the Eye which never sleeps, for to It all
things are laid bare. In that corruption <i>you</i> see no
distinction, but He knows everything; you, again,
are ignorant concerning your neighbour&rsquo;s heart: He
is familiar with all. Since, then, you do not know
how God raises from the dead, you doubt that He
<i>does</i> raise, and will doubt that He knows what is in
the human mind; for neither are these things apparent
to our bodily eyes. If, indeed, in the case of
the body, matter is visible even if it be dissolved&mdash;but
those conceptions are invisible&mdash;therefore, shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
He Who is perfectly cognisant of invisible things not
see the visible ones and not easily raise up the body?
No one will say so! Do not disbelieve in the Resurrection,
for this disbelief is in truth a diabolical
temptation, and the devil urges it, not only that the
Resurrection may be doubted, but also that he may
dissolve and destroy virtuous actions. For if a man
imagines that he is not to rise again, and not to
give an account of his works, he will not easily be
righteous, and not being righteous, he will thoroughly
mistrust the Resurrection. Each paves the way for
the other: wickedness comes from want of faith,
and want of faith from wickedness. For when a
conscience has burdened itself with much wickedness,
and since it is not willing to provide itself with
consolation by change to a better course, in fear and
anguish at the future punishment, it seeks to ease
itself in unbelief. If you say there is neither Resurrection
nor Judgment, another man&rsquo;s comment is:
&lsquo;Then I shall give no account of my actions&rsquo;. But
what are Christ&rsquo;s words? <i>You err, not knowing the
Scriptures nor the power of God.</i> In truth, God would
not have worked things so great if He had intended
not to raise us up again, but to dissolve and annihilate
us: He would not have stretched the heavens
above our heads, nor the earth under our feet, nor
have made all other things for this brief period of life
only. But if He has done this for the life which
now is, what will He not do for the life to come?
If there is to be no future life, then are we far less
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
considered, according to our present condition, than
those things which were called into existence for our
sakes. For heavens, and earth, and ocean, and
rivers are more abiding than we, as also some unreasoning
animals: the crow, the elephant, and
many others are much longer lived than we. <i>Our</i>
life is short and full of labour: it is not so with
them, but they have a long life free from despondency
and care. Tell me, how is this?&mdash;has He
made the servants happier than their masters? I
repeat it, do not reason in this way, nor humble
your intellect, nor disregard the riches of God,
having so great a Master. It was God&rsquo;s design
from the beginning to make you immortal, but you
were not willing. The being with God, the living
a life without suffering, or grief, or care, or labour,
or any other anxiety,&mdash;all this pointed to immortality.
Adam had no need of clothes, nor of
shelter, nor of any other protection, but he was
more like an angel, and he had a fore-knowledge
of many things to come, and was endued with much
wisdom. He knew what God had done in secret,
as to the creation of woman, and so he said, <i>This is
bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh</i>. Afterwards
came labour, and sweat, and shame, and cowardice,
and bondage: <i>then</i> there was neither grief nor pain,
nor effort. But he did not remain in this high state.</p>

immediately after the Crucifixion and the Resurrection
of the wonders worked by the Apostles is
that we may have a clear and unambiguous proof of
the Resurrection. You did not look upon Him
rising from the dead with your bodily eyes, but you
see Him rising with the eyes of faith. You did not
look upon Him rising with this physical eyesight of
yours, but you will see Him rising through those
signs. For their manifestation will lead you to
faith&rsquo;s contemplation. Hence the working of signs
in His name was a much greater and stronger
testimony than seeing Him as He rose from the dead.
Would you know how this establishes the Resurrection
more firmly than if it had been seen by all
men with their bodily eyes? Listen with attention,
for many men make this objection and say, &lsquo;Why,
when rising from the dead, did He not show Himself
immediately to the Jews?&rsquo; But this argument is
trifling and vain. If He had meant to enforce faith
upon them, He would not have omitted to appear to
all men after the Resurrection. Now He showed
that He did <i>not</i> mean to put force upon them by
appearing after the Resurrection: in the case of
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
Lazarus, He raised up this man, who had been four
days dead, and was corrupt and stinking, and He
made him, who was bound, come forth before all;
and not only He did not induce them to believe, but
He provoked them to anger. When they came they
wished to put Him to death on this account. Now,
if they were faithless when He raised up another,
would they not also have been mad with Him if He
had shown them Himself risen from the dead? If
they had not been able to accomplish anything, they
would still have been guilty of impiety. Thus,
wishing to save them from a useless madness, He
concealed Himself. For He would have made them
deserving of chastisement if He had appeared to them
after the Cross. Consequently, to spare them, He
hid Himself from their eyes, but manifested Himself
through signs. Hearing Peter say, <i>In the Name of
Jesus Christ arise and walk</i>, was not a less thing than
seeing Him rise again. And that this <i>was</i> a great
proof of the Resurrection, and more conducive to
faith than the first, that seeing signs taking place in
His Name was better able to persuade the minds of
men than the sight of Him risen is evident from
what I am going to say. Christ rose and showed
Himself to the disciples. Yet one of their number,
Thomas, who was called Didymus, was unbelieving,
and he demanded to put his hands into the marks of
the nails. Now, if that disciple, who had spent
three years with Him, who had partaken of his
Lord&rsquo;s table, witnessed great signs and wonders, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
heard his Lord&rsquo;s words, did not at first believe when
he even beheld Him risen, until he felt the marks of
the nails and of the wounds, tell me how would the
whole world have believed it if it had seen Him risen?
Who would say as much? But I will give you further
proof than this that signs were more persuasive than
the physical sight of the risen Lord. The crowd
hearing Peter&rsquo;s words to the lame man, <i>In the Name
of Jesus Christ arise and walk</i>, three thousand, and
five thousand believed in Christ; on the other
hand, the single disciple seeing Christ risen was
unbelieving. Do you see that the signs much
more furthered faith in the Resurrection? In
presence of the one His own disciple doubted,
whereas in contemplating the signs even enemies
were persuaded. Hence they were more powerful
and clearer; they attracted men and won them over
to the Resurrection. And why do I speak of Thomas?
For understand fully that neither were the other
disciples persuaded by their first sight of Jesus
risen; but condemn them not, dear brethren. If
Christ did not reproach them, neither should you,
for the disciples saw a strange and wonderful thing;
they saw Him rising the First-Born from the dead.
Signs so great as this are wont at first to stupify,
until in process of time they take root in the souls of
the faithful. Now, this is what happened to the
disciples. Whilst Christ risen from the dead spoke
to them the words, <i>Peace be to you</i>, the Evangelist
says they were troubled and frightened, imagining
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
they saw a spirit, and Jesus said to them, <i>Why are
ye fearful?</i> And after that He showed them His
Hands and Feet, and He said to them, whom joy
and wonder made unbelieving, <i>Have you anything to
eat?</i> wishing to convince them through these material
things of the Resurrection. &lsquo;Do neither My Side
nor My Wounds persuade you, then let even food
persuade you.&rsquo; That you may clearly understand
that He said, <i>Have you anything to eat here?</i> in order
to show them they beheld not a vision, nor a spirit,
nor a phantom, but a true and substantial resurrection,
consider how Peter is convinced of it in this very
way. For in saying that <i>God had raised Him from
the dead and had given Him to appear in a glorious form
to us His preordained witnesses</i>, he added, as a proof of
the Resurrection: <i>we who ate and drank with Him</i>.
This was why whenever Christ raised anyone from
the dead, in order to prove the Resurrection, He said:
<i>Give him to eat</i>. When, therefore, you hear that He
offered Himself to them in the body during forty
days, appearing to them and living with them,
understand His reason for eating with them. It
was not that He required food, but He wished to
strengthen the weakness of the disciples; whence it
is plain that the signs and wonders of the Apostles
were the greatest proof of the Resurrection. Therefore,
His own words were: <i>Amen, Amen, I say to you,
he who believeth in Me shall do the works which I do, and
greater works than I do</i>. For since the Cross coming
between had scandalised many, He required even
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
greater signs after it. If, indeed, Christ in ending
His life had remained in death and the tomb, and
had not risen, as the Jews pretend, nor ascended
into heaven, not only were greater signs not required
to come after the cross, but even the former ones
should have been blotted out. Follow my argument
attentively, as what I have said is an irrefutable
proof of the Resurrection, and therefore I repeat it.
First, Christ did wonders, He raised the dead and
cleansed lepers, and cast out devils: after this He
was crucified, and, as the lawless Jews assert, He did
not rise from the dead. Now, how are we to answer
them? That if He did <i>not</i> rise, how after this did
greater signs take place in His Name? No living
man at his death ever worked greater wonders after
it, but in this case they <i>were</i> greater after it, both in
manner and in matter. They were greater in matter,
for never had the shadow of Christ raised from the
dead, yet the shadows of the Apostles did many
things of this kind. And they were greater in manner
when at His command signs took place; but after
the crucifixion His servants, using His awful and all-holy
Name, did greater and more wonderful things,
so that their power shone forth more conspicuously
than His. For it was much more striking that
another should do these things by invoking His
Name than that He should command them to be
done. See you, dear brethren, how the signs of
the Apostles after Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection were greater
both in manner and in matter? Therefore, the proof
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
of the Resurrection is irrefutable. As I was saying,
and now repeat, if Christ had died and not risen
again, wonders also should have ceased and been
extinguished: now, not only were they not quenched,
but they became more evident and more glorious
after these things. And if Christ had not risen,
others would not have worked signs so great in His
Name. One and the same power did wonders both
before and after the Cross, first through Himself and
afterwards through His disciples; but the greater and
more wonderful signs took place after the Cross in
order that the proof of the Resurrection might be
the clearer and more renowned. &lsquo;And how,&rsquo; the
unbeliever asks, &lsquo;is it certain that signs <i>did</i> take
place?&rsquo; &lsquo;How is it certain that Christ was crucified?&rsquo;
&lsquo;From Holy Scripture,&rsquo; you answer. And
it is also evident from Holy Scripture both that signs
took place then and that Christ was crucified, for
they say one and the other. And if the adversary
assert that the Apostles did no signs, he shows their
power and divine grace to have been the greater,
inasmuch as without wonders they were able to
win such a world to the service of God.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> For this
is the greatest sign and the crowning wonder of all,
that the lowly, and poor, and despised, and ignorant,
and unlearned, and needy, twelve men in number,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
seem without signs to drag in their train cities so
great, and races and peoples, kings, tyrants, philosophers,
and orators, and, so to speak, the whole
world. Would you like to see signs taking place
now? Then I will show you signs more striking
than the former ones&mdash;not one dead man raised to
life, not one blind man restored to sight, but the
whole world freed from the darkness of error; not
one leper cleansed, but entire nations washed from
the leprosy of sin and purified through baptism to
regeneration. What greater signs than these would
you have, O man, contemplating so radical a change
over the face of the earth?</p>
<p>Would you know how Christ restored sight to the
world? Men began by looking at wood and stone,
not as wood and stone, but were so blinded as to
invoke material things as gods: now, however, that
they have seen what wood is and what stone is, they
believe what God is, for that high and blessed nature
is contemplated by faith alone. Would you have
another sign of the Resurrection? You will find it
in the knowledge of the disciples, which was increased
after the Resurrection. For it is admitted by all
that one who is well-disposed towards a living man
thinks no more of him when he is dead, but if he
dislikes the living man, and if he deserts him whilst
present, much more will he forget him when dead.
Hence, no one who neglected a friend and counsellor
when living will make much of him when dead,
especially when he finds a thousand dangers
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
threatening himself if he should be so minded.
Yet, what took place in the case of no other man
<i>did</i> take place with Christ and His Apostles and
those who had denied and forsaken Him during His
life, who had left Him when apprehended, and turned
their backs upon Him after numberless reproaches,
made so much of the Cross, as to give up their own
lives for their testimony and for their faith in Him.
If Christ did not die and did not rise again, what
reason was there that those who had fled from Him
when living, on account of impending danger, should
have encountered a thousand dangers for Him when
dead? Now they all fled from Him, and Peter,
besides, denied Him thrice with an oath, and he
who denied Him thrice with an oath, and was
frightened at a poor maid-servant, after His death,
wishing to persuade us through their acts that he had
seen Him risen, became so thoroughly changed that he
defied all the people, and went out into the midst
of the Jews and proclaimed that He Who was crucified
and buried had risen from the dead on the third
day, and had ascended into heaven, and that he
himself feared no evil. Whence came this courage
of his? Whence, if not from his conviction of the
Resurrection? For since he had seen Christ, and
spoken with Him, and had heard future things foretold,
risking the rest of his life as if for a living man,
he so confronted all adverse things that he took
fresh strength and courage, so as to die for Him,
and to be crucified with his head downwards.
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
Therefore when you see greater signs taking place,
and the disciples showing more feeling for Him
Whom they at first deserted, and a bolder fearlessness,
and the change in morals becoming everywhere
more marked, and bringing everything into
a secure and happy state, learn through practical
experience that the personal history of Christ did
not stop at the death of Christ, but a Resurrection
received Him, and He lives and remains immutably
the crucified God for ever. If He had not risen and
were not living, the disciples would not have worked
greater wonders than had taken place before the
Cross. <i>Then</i> the disciples even had left Him: <i>now</i>
the whole world seeks Him out, and not Peter alone,
but thousands of others; and after Peter many more,
who never saw Him, have given up their lives for
Him. They have lost their heads and suffered
numberless evils in order to maintain a pure and
entire belief in Him until their death. How then
could a dead man lying in his tomb, as you say, O
Jew, have shown forth so great a strength and
power even in those coming after Him, persuading
them to adore Him alone, and to be willing to endure
and suffer anything rather than to give up their
faith in Him? Do you not see this clear proof of
the Resurrection in every particular? Through the
signs then and now, through the affection of the
disciples then and now, through the perils in which
believers passed their lives? Would you see His
enemies too fearing His strength and His power,
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
and in much greater straits after His crucifixion?
Give your minds, then, to this also. The Jews
seeing the courage of Peter and John, the Scripture
says, and considering that they were ignorant and
untaught men, wondered and were dismayed, not
that they were illiterate, but that, being illiterate,
they got the better of all the wise, and seeing the
man who had been healed standing with them, they
could say nothing against it, although before this
they <i>had</i> had something to say against it when they
saw signs taking place. Now, why had they
nothing to say then? The invisible power of the
Crucified had sealed their tongues. He it was Who
had silenced their mouths and put down their boldness,
so that they stood there, and could not gainsay
them. And when they <i>did</i> speak, see how they
admit their own cowardice. <i>Would you draw down
upon us the blood of this man?</i> For if He be a mere
man, why fear His blood? How many prophets
have you removed, O Jew, how many just have
you slain, and have you feared the blood of any one
of them? Why, then, did you fear in this case?
The Crucified awed their conscience; and not being
able to conceal their struggle, they reveal their own
weakness towards their enemies in spite of themselves.
And when they crucified Him, they cried
out, saying, <i>His blood be upon us and upon our children</i>.
Thus did they despise His blood. But after
the Cross, seeing His power shine forth, they are
afraid and distressed, and say, <i>Would you draw down</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
<i>the blood of this man upon us?</i> If indeed he was a
deceiver, and impious, as you false Jews say, why
did you fear His blood? If He were this you should
have prided yourselves on putting Him to death,
but because He was not this, therefore, are you
in fear.</p>
<p>Do you see how everywhere His enemies are distressed
and afraid? Do you see their anguish?
Learn, too, the kindness of the Crucified. They
said, <i>His blood be upon us and upon our children</i>. Not
so Christ, but, supplicating the Father, He said,
<i>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do</i>.
For, if His blood had indeed fallen upon them and
upon their children, the Apostles would not have
been made out of their children; neither three thousand
nor five thousand would have believed on the
spot. See you how barbarous and cruel as they
were towards their descendants, they ignored even
nature itself, whilst God was more loving than all
fathers put together and tenderer than any mother?
Still His blood <i>was</i> upon them and upon their children,
though not upon all their children, but on those
alone who emulated the impiety and unrighteousness
of their fathers. Those alone were liable
to the evils who were sons, not according to nature,
but through their own foolish choice. Look with
me at another side of the goodness and lovingness
of God. He did not at once let the chastisement
and penalty fall upon them, but He allowed forty
years and more to pass after the Cross. Our Lord
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
Himself was crucified under Tiberius, and their city
was destroyed under Vespasian and Titus. Now,
why did He allow so long a time to elapse after these
things? Because He wished to give them time for
repentance, so that they might put off their iniquities
and be quit of their crimes. As, having a
respite for conversion, they remained in their impenitence,
He at last inflicted punishment upon
them, and, destroying their city, sent them out wanderers
over the face of the earth. And this He did
through love. He dispersed them that they might
everywhere see that Christ Whom they had crucified
adored, and that, seeing Him adored by all,
they might learn His power and acknowledge their
own exceeding wickedness, and in acknowledging it
might come to the truth. And indeed their humiliation
became a teaching to them and their chastisement
a remedy, for, if they had remained in the
country of the Jews, they would not have recognised
the truth of the prophets. What had the prophets
said? <i>Ask of me and I will give you the gentiles
for your inheritance and the ends of the earth as
your possession.</i> Thus it behoved them to go out to
the ends of the earth that they might see with their
own eyes that Christ reigns even there. Again,
another prophet says, <i>Each one shall adore Him from
his own place</i>. Therefore it was necessary that they
should be dispersed into every corner of the earth,
that with their very eyes they might see every man
adoring Him from his own place. Again, another
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
says, <i>The earth shall be filled with the knowledge
of the Lord as the waters cover the sea</i>. Therefore,
it was fitting that they should go forth unto
all the earth, that they might see it all filled
with the knowledge of God, and <i>seas</i>, that is,
these spiritual churches, with His fear. On this
account God dispersed them throughout the earth.
If they had established themselves in Jud&aelig;a, they
would not have known these things. He wishes
too that they should experience with their eyes
both the truth of the prophets and His own
power, so that, if they be right-minded, they may
be thus led to the truth, whilst, if they follow
impiety, they may have no excuse in the terrible
day of judgment. Therefore, God dispersed them
over the earth that we too may draw profit
hence, that, seeing the prophecies concerning their
dispersion and the destruction of Jerusalem, which
Daniel, in recalling the abomination of desolation,
and Malachias, in saying, <i>The gates shall be shut
in you</i>, and David and Isaias and many other
prophets have foretold, and how those are chastised
who did not receive their Lord, cut off
from their national liberty, from all their domestic
ties and hereditary customs, may understand the
power which accomplishes and works these things,
and that enemies may see His strength through
our gain. May we indeed learn through their
chastisement His infinite kindness and power,
and may we be constant in giving Him praise,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
so that we may arrive at eternal and unspeakable
goods by the grace and goodness of Our
Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom, with the Father and
the Son, be honour and power, now and for ever.
Amen.</p>

<h3 id="c44">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Thou art Peter.</span>&rdquo;
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, liv., vol. ii., p. 108.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>... <i>Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be
called Cephas.</i> Since thou hast proclaimed <i>My</i>
Father, He says, so will I name <i>thy</i> father to thee:
which was almost saying, &lsquo;As thou art the son of
Jona, so am I the Son of My Father&rsquo;. For it was
superfluous to say, &lsquo;Thou art the son of Jona&rsquo;; but
as He had spoken of the Son of God, in order to
show that as Peter is the son of Jona so He is the
Son of God, of the same substance as the Begetter,
He added further: <i>And I say to thee thou art Peter,
and upon this rock I will build My Church</i>&mdash;that is, on
the faith of this confession. Then He shows him
many men who are ready to believe, and He
strengthens Peter&rsquo;s will and makes him pastor.
<i>And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</i> &lsquo;If
they shall not prevail against <i>it</i>, how much less
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
against Me. So be not troubled, for thou art soon
to hear that I am to be betrayed and crucified.&rsquo; He
goes on to speak of another honour: <i>And I will give
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven</i>. What does <i>And
I will give thee</i> signify? As the Father gave thee to
know Me, so do <i>I</i> also give it to thee. He did not
say: &lsquo;I will invoke the Father,&rsquo; although the power
shown forth was so great and the gift was so
unutterably magnificent, but <i>I will give thee</i>. Tell
me what hast Thou given? The keys of the
kingdom of heaven, that whatsoever thou dost bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever
thou dost loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
How, then, was it not His to give to sit on His right
and on His left Who said, <i>I will give</i>? Do you see
how He leads Peter up to the most ineffable knowledge,
how He reveals Himself, and shows Himself
to be the Son of God, through that double promise?
For that which belongs only to God, namely, the
remission of sins, the setting up of an immutable
Church in the midst of waves, and making a fisherman
more enduring than the hardest rock, with the
whole world against him, these are the things which
He promises to give, as the Father said to Jeremias:
<i>I have made thee a pillar of iron and a wall of brass</i>;
but Jeremias was commissioned for one people,
whilst Peter is charged with the whole universe. I
would ask those who wish to depreciate the dignity
of the Son, which were the greater gifts to Peter,
those of the Father or those of the Son? The
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
Father vouchsafed to Peter the manifestation of the
Son, but the Son&rsquo;s gift it was to make known that
manifestation of the Father and of Himself throughout
all the world, and He entrusted to a mortal man
authority over the whole kingdom of heaven, giving
those keys to him who propagated the Church in all
parts of the earth and showed it forth more powerful
than heaven. <i>For heaven and earth shall pass away, but
My words shall not pass away.</i> How, then, was the
Giver of such gifts, the Worker of such triumphs, in
any way less than the Father? I speak of them,
not separating the works of the Father from the
Son, <i>for all things were made through Him, and without
Him nothing was made</i>, but in order to silence the
shameless tongue of those who would so venture.
Consider the authority which He manifests here
throughout all He says. <i>I say to thee, thou art Peter:
I will build My Church: I will give thee the keys of the
kingdom of heaven.</i> And at the time when He said
these things, He charged them to tell no man that
He was the Christ. Why did He thus charge them?
That when those who took scandal were removed,
the work of the Cross over, and all His other
sufferings completed, when there was no man left to
disturb or trouble the faith of the multitude in Him,
His worship, undefiled and immutable, might be
grafted on the minds of those who listened. For it
was clear that His power had not yet shone forth.
On this account He willed to be preached by them
at a time when the unerring truth of deeds and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
strength of things accomplished should support the
testimony of the Apostles. For there was a difference
between seeing Him, now working wonders in
Palestine, now despised, now driven about (more
especially at the time when the Cross was about to
follow the wonders accomplished), and seeing Him
adored and trusted by the whole world, His former
suffering no more. This is why He enjoined them
to tell no man. For that which has once been
rooted and is then torn up, would with difficulty, if
planted again, be received by the many, but that
which has once been secured, and which remains
immutable, and is not threatened from any quarter,
is in easy progress and gives good promise of growth.
If, indeed, those who enjoyed many signs, and who
took part in these ineffable mysteries, were scandalised
by merely being told of the Cross, and not
those only, but Peter too, the head of all,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> consider
what the multitude were likely to suffer when they
learnt that He was the Son of God, and saw Him
spit upon and crucified, and yet did not know the
sacred nature of these high mysteries, and had not
received the Holy Ghost. If He said even to the
disciples, <i>I have many things to say to you, but you
cannot bear them now</i>, how much more would the
rest of the people have fallen if He had revealed to
them the secret of these hidden things before the
due time. On this account, then, He orders them to
be silent. And that you may see how much there
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
was to be learnt after these things to complete the
teaching, when those who offered scandal were
removed, consider the behaviour of Peter, the chief
of all. For this very Peter, after wonders so great,
showed himself weak enough to deny Our Lord and
to fear a poor maid-servant. Then, when the crucifixion
was accomplished, and he had received clear
proof of the resurrection, and there remained nothing
to scandalise or terrify him, he embraced the unspeakable
teaching of the Spirit in order to leap with
greater eagerness than a lion upon the Jewish
people, although he was threatened by a thousand
dangers and deaths. It was reasonable, therefore,
that He bade them not to tell the multitude before
the Cross, since He did not venture to impart everything
before the Cross even to those who were to
teach. <i>I have many things to say, but you cannot bear
them now.</i> And they were ignorant concerning many
things spoken by Him which He did not clearly
explain before the Cross. But when He rose from
the dead, then they came to a knowledge of some of
the things which He had said.</p>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>

<h3 id="c45">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Peter Rose Up.</span>&rdquo;
<br />(<i>Homilies on Acts of Apostles</i>, <i>Benedictine Edition</i>, iii., tom. ix., p. 23.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>And in those days Peter rose up in the midst of the
disciples and said.</i> As one eager and as entrusted by
Christ with the flock, and as the first of the choir,
he ever first begins to speak. <i>And the number of
names together was</i>, he says, <i>about a hundred and
twenty</i>. <i>Men and brethren, this Scripture must needs
have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before.</i>
Why then did he not singly ask of Christ to give
him some one in the place of Judas? And why do
they not make the election of themselves? Peter
had now become better than his old self. This is
what we may say on the subject. We will give two
reasons why their asking for one to fill up their band
was no chance but a matter of revelation: the first,
that they were engaged about other things; the
second, that this was the greatest proof of Christ&rsquo;s
presence with them. For being absent He made
the election as He would have done if present.
And this was no small matter of consolation. But
observe Peter doing this with common consent;
nothing authoritatively, nothing arbitrarily. And
he did not say simply thus: &lsquo;Instead of Judas we
elect this man,&rsquo; but consoling them about what had
passed, see how he manages his discourse. For
what had happened had caused no small distress.
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
And do not wonder at this. For if many at present
twist about this fact, what may we expect that they
said? <i>Men and brethren</i>, he says: if the Lord called
them brethren, how much more he?... This is
why he began by saying, <i>Men and brethren, we must
choose one of us</i>. He commits the judgment to the
multitude, both to invest with respect those who
were chosen, and to escape himself odium from the
rest.... What, then, might not Peter himself have
elected? Certainly. But he does not do so, that
he might not seem partial. Moreover, he had not
as yet received the Spirit. <i>And they appointed two,
Joseph that is called Barsabas and Matthias.</i> He
did not appoint them, but all. He introduced the
matter, showing that it was not even his own, but
from above, according to prophecy. So that he was
an interpreter, not a master.</p>

waves roll, they cannot sink the bark of Jesus. Tell
me, what should we fear? Death? <i>To me to live
is Christ and to die gain.</i> Is it exile perchance? <i>The
earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and the fulness of it.</i> Is it confiscation
of property? We brought nothing with
us into the world, and it is clear that we can take nothing
away with us. I despise what the world fears,
and hold its good things in derision. I do not fear
poverty, nor do I desire riches. I am not afraid of
death; I do not pray to live, if it be not for your
good. This is why I speak of what is now taking
place, and exhort your charity to be of good cheer.
For no man shall be able to separate us. No man
can part that which God has joined together. If,
speaking of man and wife, He says: <i>On this account
a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall
cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh; for
that which God has joined together man shall not
separate</i>; if you cannot dissolve marriage, how much
less shall you be able to break up the Church of
God. You may fight her, you will not be able to
harm the object of your attack. &lsquo;But whilst you
make me more illustrious, you are undermining your
own strength by fighting against me.&rsquo; It is hard for
you to kick against a sharp goad. You do not take
the edge off it, but you make your own feet bloody;
and the waves do not break through the rock, but
are dissolved in foam. There is nothing more
powerful than the Church, O man; give up fighting
her, lest she overpower your strength. Wage not
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
war against heaven. If you fight a man, you conquer
or are conquered. But if you fight the Church, you
cannot conquer. For God is stronger than all. <i>Do
we provoke the Lord to jealousy?</i> Are we stronger than
He? Who will venture to subvert the order which
God has established? You know not His power.
He looks down upon the earth and causes it to tremble.
He commands, and that which was shaken becomes
firm. If He can establish in peace a city torn by
factions, how much more is He able to establish the
Church! The Church is stronger than heaven.
<i>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall
not pass away.</i> What words? <i>Thou art Peter, and
upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.</i></p>
<p>If you distrust words, believe in facts. How
many tyrants have wished to get the better of the
Church! How many frying-pans, and furnaces, and
fangs of wild animals, and sharp swords have there
not been! Yet they have not succeeded. Where
are the oppressors? Silence and oblivion have
passed over them. But where is the Church? It
is more dazzling than the sun. <i>Their</i> deeds are no
more, hers are immortal. Now, if being few they
were not conquered, how will you get the better of
them, now that the world is filled with the service
of God? <i>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My
word shall not pass</i>; and with good reason. The
Church is more pleasing to God than heaven; He
did not take a body from heaven, but He <i>did</i> take
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
flesh of the Church.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
Heaven is made for the
Church, not the Church for heaven. Be not disturbed
by anything which has taken place. Gain me
the grace of an immutable faith. See you not Peter
walking upon the waters, beginning to doubt and
being on the point of drowning, not through the
surging waves, but through the weakness of his
faith? Did we come here by vote of man? Did a
man bring us in, that a man might displace us? I
say this, not out of pride, nor to boast&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;but
wishing to give courage to what is faint in you.
Since the city has become quiet, the devil aimed at
disturbing the Church. Wretched and most wicked
demon, you could not master walls, and do you think
to shake the Church? Is the Church made up of
walls? The Church is in the multitude of the
faithful. What an array of immutable pillars, not
clasped by iron, but bound by faith! I say not that
so vast a multitude is more ardent than fire, but if
it consisted of one, you would not overcome that
one. You know what wounds the martyrs inflicted
on you. Many a time a tender maiden has been
brought into court; she was softer than wax, and
she became harder than a rock. You tore her sides,
yet you took not her faith. The flesh languished
whilst the strength of faith was not weakened: the
body was being spent, the spirit was renewed: the
physical frame was perishing, yet piety endured.
You have not conquered a single woman, and do you
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
hope to conquer so numerous a people? <i>Do you not
hear the Lord saying, Wherever two or three are
gathered together in My name, there I am in the midst of
them</i>. Where is <i>not</i> this people whom charity
binds? I have a proof of it. Am I in good heart
by my own strength? I hold His written word.
This is my staff, this is my courage, this is to me a
calm harbour. Even if the world be troubled, I
hold that written word; I look up to those words,
they are a wall of strength to me. What are they?
<i>I am with you always until the consummation of the
world.</i> Christ is with me, what shall I fear? If
waves are raging against me, and the fountains of
the deep and the passions of princes, all these things
are more insignificant than a cobweb. And if it were
not for your charity, I would not refuse to depart
to-morrow, for I always say, &lsquo;Lord, may Thy will be
done&rsquo;; not what this man or that man wishes, but as
Thou wilt. This is my tower of defence, this is my
immutable rock, this is my sure staff. If this be God&rsquo;s
will, so be it. If He wish me to remain here, I am grateful
to Him. Wherever it may be, I give Him thanks.</p>

<h3 id="c47"><span class="sc">The Priest a Man, not an Angel.</span>
<br />(<i>Homily on Peter and Elias</i>, <i>Benedictine Edition</i>, tom. ii., p. 730.)</h3>
<p>Why is it that so few are here to day? We commemorate
the martyrs, and no one comes; the distance
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
has made man soft, or rather not the distance,
but their softness has been the impediment. Just
as nothing can hinder readiness and alertness of
will, so everything serves as a hindrance to an
irresolute and desponding man. The martyrs shed
their blood for the truth: can <i>you</i> not make light
even of a long way? They laid down their head for
Christ: will <i>you</i> not even come out of the city for
your Lord? He died for you, and are you lukewarm
in His service? You are commemorating the martyrs,
and are you discouraged and remiss? You should
come and see the devil humbled, and the martyr
triumphing, God glorified, and the Church crowned.
What is your excuse? &lsquo;I am a sinner and I cannot
come.&rsquo; That is the very reason why you should
come so that you may not be quite lost. Tell me what
man is without sin? This is why there is a sacrifice,
and a Church, and prayer, and fasting. Because the
soul has many wounds, therefore remedies have been
devised for them, and for every single wound of the
soul a corresponding medicine has been prepared.
You have the Church offering sacrifices, the prayers
of the fathers, the administration of the Holy Spirit,
the memory of the martyrs, the assembly of the faithful,
and many things of the kind which have power to
recall you from iniquity unto justice. If you do not
come to invoke the martyrs, what excuse have you
got?... You say, &lsquo;I am a sinner and cannot come&rsquo;.
<i>Because</i> you are a sinner, come. Or do you not know
that those very men who stand before the altar have
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
contracted sins? They are clothed in flesh and blood,
yet we do not refuse to teach when we cast our eyes
on the ocean of God&rsquo;s goodness. If you enter in, you
have not this against you, for you are subject to teaching.
As for us, the higher our dignity, the greater is
our guilt. It is one thing for the man, who is subject to
teaching, to sin, and another for the teacher. Nevertheless,
we do not refuse to impart discipline, or fall
into negligence under pretext of humility. It was a
divine ordering that priests themselves should fall
into sin. Now listen to what I mean. If the teachers
themselves, if priests had not sinned and been subjected
to the ordinary passions of life, they would
have become inhuman and relentless towards others.
Therefore, He designed that priests, too, and rulers
should be under the dominion of their feelings, so
that from what they themselves experience they
should extend pardon to others. God has always
pursued this course, not only now but of old: He
allowed those to whom He was going to entrust His
Church and His people to fall into sin, so that on
account of their own shortcomings they might become
merciful to others. If they had <i>not</i> sinned, they would
not have made a single excuse for sinners, but, wholly
merciless, would have excluded all from the Church.
Let me show you by an example that it <i>is</i> so, and that
I do not speak from conjecture. Peter was to be
entrusted with the keys of heaven and with the multitude
of the people. For what were the Lord&rsquo;s words
to him? <i>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
<i>be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</i> For Peter was
somewhat severe, and if he had been faultless how
would he have excused his disciples? This was why
the Divine Goodness brought about a certain fall on
his part, that from what he himself experienced, he
might become kind to others. And consider the man
who is allowed to fall into sin,&mdash;Peter, the chief of
the Apostles, the irremovable foundation, the immutable
rock, the leader of the Church, the sure
harbour, the invincible pillar. Peter it was who had
said to Christ, <i>Even if I should die with Thee I will not
desert Thee</i>; Peter who had confessed the truth by
divine revelation: <i>Thou art Christ the Son of the living
God</i>: this Peter going in on the night of Christ&rsquo;s
betrayal and standing by the fire to warm himself, a
certain maid-servant went up to him and said, <i>Yesterday
thou wert with this man</i>, and Peter answered, <i>I
know not the man</i>. Just before he had said, <i>Even if I
should die with Thee</i>; now he denies Him and says,
<i>I know not the man</i>. O Peter! is this thy promise?
Thou hast not endured torments nor stripes, but at a
single word from a maid-servant&mdash;thou hast denied.
Wilt thou deny, Peter? As yet there are neither
torments, nor stripes, nor blows, nor angry passions,
nor princes, nor outstretched swords, neither edicts,
nor threatening emperors, nor sentence to death,
neither prisons, nor precipices, nor seas. There are
none of these things, yet thou hast already denied
Him: <i>I know not the man</i>. Again the maid said to him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
<i>Yesterday thou wert with this man.</i> And he answered
her: <i>I know not the man</i>. Who is making thee deny?
No one in authority, but a woman, and she a poor
doorkeeper, a captive unworthy of an answer: at
<i>her</i> word thou deniest! This is wonderful indeed!
A maid-servant, a harlot going up to Peter disturbed
his faith. Peter, the pillar, suffered no temptation:
she only opened her mouth and that pillar was shaken,
that bulwark was moved. What seest thou before
thee, Peter, whilst thou deniest? A miserable maid-servant,
a wretched doorkeeper. This is what thou
seest, and dost thou deny? Now for the third time
she says: <i>Yesterday thou too wert with this man</i>, and he
denied for the third time. And Jesus looking at him,
recalled his own words to his mind, and he began to
weep tears of contrition for his sin. Still Jesus
pardoned him, knowing that as a man he had had a
human weakness. But as I have said, on this account
He was about to entrust him with a whole people, so
that, not being hard or without sin, he might not be
without mercy for his own brethren. He fell into sin,
that, considering his own fault and his Lord&rsquo;s pardon,
he also might extend a merciful forgiveness to others,
which, according to divine dispensation should reconcile
them to God. He who was to be entrusted with
the Church was allowed to sin; the pillar of the
churches, the harbour of faith, Peter the teacher of
the world, was allowed to sin in order that his forgiveness
might become the basis of mercy for others.
Why do I say these things? Because we priests
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
who sit upon a throne and teach are fettered by sins.
This is why neither angel nor archangel has been
entrusted with the priesthood, for <i>they</i> are without
sin, in order that they should not through severity at
once strike down sinners amongst the people. A
man born of man was entrusted with this throne,
a man held subject himself to pleasure and to sin, so
that in receiving a sinner, mindful of his own failings,
he might be gentler to that sinner. For if the priest
were an angel and were to receive a dissolute man, he
would kill him on the spot, not being acquainted
with this passion. On this account if an angel had
the sacerdotal authority, he would not teach, but he
would kill the man in anger through his not being an
angel: for this reason it was a man with the knowledge
and experience of his own faults, that he might
pardon sinners, and not be moved by anger, that the
Church might not be vacant through the Synagogue.</p>

<h3 id="c48"><span class="sc">The Authority of the Priest.</span>
<br />(<i>On the Priesthood</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> b. iii., c. iv., p. 24.)</h3>
<p>The priesthood performs its functions on earth
but ranks with heavenly things. And indeed most
rightly, for neither man, nor angel, nor archangel,
nor any other created power has ordained this series
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
of actions, but the Paraclete Himself, and He it is
Who has inspired those still in the flesh to represent
visibly the ministry of angels. Therefore, since the
priest stands in the very heavens in the midst of
those powers, he should be as pure as they. The
ordinances before the law of grace, such as bells and
fringes, and precious stones on the breast, those on
the shoulders, the mitre, the girdle, the long garment,
the gold plate, the holy of holies, the intense quiet
of the holy place, were awful and sacred, but if anyone
would examine those of the law of grace, he
would find the former terrible ordinances were as
nothing, and that what was then said concerning
the law was in this also true, that <i>even that which
was glorious in this part was not glorified by reason of the
glory that excelleth</i>. For when you see the Lord
sacrificed and lying before you, and the priest
standing over the sacrifice making supplication, and
all present dyed in the precious Blood, do you feel
as if you were still amongst men and on earth, and
not rather transported straight into heaven? Casting
aside from your mind every carnal thought, do you
not consider the things of heaven with a naked soul
and a pure heart? Oh, what a wonder this is! What
man-loving kindness of God! He Who is sitting
with the Father above is received in that hour into
the hands of all men. And He gives Himself to
those who wish to hold Him to their hearts in close
embrace, and all do this through their eyes. Now
would these things appear to you worthy of contempt,
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
as if a man could possibly feel anger against them?
Would you like to realise the surpassing sacredness
of this holy place through another wonder? Picture
Elias to yourselves, an immense crowd surrounding
him, the sacrifice lying upon stones, all men holding
their breath, and the prophet alone in prayer, then
fire coming swiftly from heaven upon the offering.
This is a marvel which is most awe-inspiring. Pass
on from this to the rites which are now being carried
out, and you will see not marvels alone but things
beyond awe itself. For the priest is standing there,
not bringing down fire but the Holy Spirit: and he
makes a long prayer of supplication, not that fire
from above may consume the offering, but in order
that grace, coming down upon the sacrifice, may
through it enkindle all souls, and make them purer
than silver purified in the fire. Now, such being
this most tremendous rite, who that is not utterly
mad and out of his mind will be able to show
contempt for it? Do you not know that never
could soul of man have borne that fire of the sacrifice,
but all would have been consumed if it had not
been for an abundant assistance of God&rsquo;s grace? If,
indeed, anyone would consider what a great thing
it is for a man still clothed in flesh and blood to be
able to approach nearer to that high and perfect
nature, he would then clearly see what honour the
grace of the Spirit has vouchsafed to confer upon the
priest. For through his ministry both these things
are accomplished and other things which, in regard
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
to our dignity and salvation, are in no way inferior.
Dwellers on the earth, sojourners here, are entrusted
with the things of heaven, and have received an
authority which God has given neither to angels nor
to archangels. Not to them are those words said:
<i>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose shall be loosed</i>. It
is true that those in power on earth have authority
to bind, but in the case of bodies only: now <i>that</i> chain
affects the soul, and penetrates into heaven, so that
whatsoever the priest does here below, God ratifies
it above; the Lord of all sanctions the action of His
servants. What indeed did He give to them if not
all authority in heaven? <i>Whose sins</i>, He says, <i>you
shall forgive they are forgiven, and whose sins you shall
retain they are retained</i>. What could be greater than
this authority? The Father has given all judgment
to the Son: now I see them set over all judgment
by the Son as if they were already in heaven, and
had passed beyond nature, and had thrown off our
passions also, to so great an authority have they
been raised. Thus, if a king entrusts to one of his
subjects power to throw into prison those whom he
chooses, and to release them, that man will be an
object of singular distinction to all. He who receives
from God an authority greater in proportion
as heaven surpasses earth and souls bodies, has
seemed to some to be favoured with an honour so
small as to make it credible that some one might
look down upon the gift of men so trusted. God
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
forbid such unreason, for it <i>is</i> a consummate unreason
to despise so exalted an authority, without which we
can arrive neither at salvation nor at the promised
goods. If a man cannot enter into the kingdom of
heaven unless he be born again of water and the
Spirit, and if he who does not eat the Flesh of Christ
and does not drink His Blood shall have no part in
eternal life, and all these things are brought about
by no one else, but only by those sacred hands,
those of the priest, I mean, how without them
will it be possible for a man either to escape hell-fire
or to reach the crowns which are laid up for us?
For priests are those who have been trusted with
throes of the Spirit, and they generate through
baptism: through them we put on Christ and unite
ourselves to the Son of God, and become members
of that august Head. Hence they might justly be
held by us in greater veneration than not rulers and
kings only, but than our own fathers. These have
generated us by ties of the flesh and of inclination:
priests are the authors of our birth from God, of
that blessed regeneration of our true liberty, and of
our adoption according to grace. Priests amongst
the Jews had power to cleanse the leprosy of the
body, or rather not at all to cleanse it, but only to
proclaim who <i>were</i> cleansed, and you know how
sought after the priestly office then was. Now
these have received power with regard to, not the
leprosy of the body, but impurity of the soul, not to
examine it when cleansed but to entirely effect the
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
cleansing. Hence, those who hold them in contempt
would be under a worse curse and would deserve a
greater chastisement than Dathan and his companions.
The latter, indeed, even if they claimed
an authority which did not belong to them, were
still impressed with its being something extraordinary,
and showed this by desiring it with great
warmth; but the former, since a better order has
been brought about and divine worship has received
so wonderful an increase, have ventured on a deed
the opposite to that of the others, of much greater
audacity. To desire undue honour and to disregard
it are not forms of showing contempt; but the
one is as far removed from the other as is the
measure of contempt from admiration. What soul
so unhappy as to disregard goods so great? I cannot
say, unless anyone should be goaded on to it by a
demon. Now I will go back to my starting-point.
God has given greater power to priests than to
parents, according to nature, not only for chastising
but also for conferring benefits, and there is as great
a difference between the two as between this present
life and the life to come. Earthly parents generate
for this present life, priests for the life to come: the
former are unable to preserve their children from
death even of the body or to ward off illness from
them; but the latter have often saved a soul which
was sick and about to be lost, procuring for some a
milder chastisement, and keeping others out of
trouble from the first, not only by teaching and
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
advising, but also by helping them with prayer. Not
only do they generate us anew, but after this they
have authority to remit sins. <i>Is any man sick among
you</i>, the Apostle says, <i>let him call in the elders of the
Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with
oil in the Name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith
shall save the sick man, and the Lord shall raise him up,
and whatever sins he may have committed shall be forgiven
him</i>. So parents in the order of nature can do
nothing to help their children if these should chance
to offend people in high places; but priests have
reconciled them not to rulers or kings only, but
to God Himself, Who was angered against them.
After this will anyone venture to accuse us of folly?
For my part I conceive that what has been said will
inspire the souls of hearers with such respect that
they will no longer charge with folly and audacity
those who shrink from acquiring this honour for
themselves, but those who seek and pursue it.</p>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<h3 id="c49"><span class="sc">The Priest a Shepherd of Souls.</span>
<br />(<i>On the Priesthood</i>, b. vi., c. i.)</h3>
<p>You have heard what is to be expected here on
earth, but how shall we bear what is to come hereafter,
when we shall be compelled to answer for
everyone who has been entrusted to us? The
punishment there does not stop with shame, but is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
chastisement which never ends. If I began by
quoting the words, <i>Render obedience and submission to
those who are over you, and who are responsible for your
souls, as giving an account for them</i>, I will not now
withhold them. Fear of this judgment keeps me in
a state of perpetual trembling. If, indeed, for scandalising
one, and that one the least of all, it is better
for a man to have a millstone about his neck and to
be cast into the sea; and if all who inflict a blow
upon the conscience of their brethren sin against
Christ Himself, what will be the suffering on their
account of those who destroy not one, or two, or
three, but so great a multitude? It will not do to
throw the blame on want of practice or to take
refuge in ignorance, or to allege necessity or main
force: it would be easier for a subject, if he required
it, to make use of this excuse for his own sins than
for rulers in those of others. What is meant by
this? That he whose part it is to correct the ignorance
of others, and to guard against the devil&rsquo;s
coming attack, may not allege his own ignorance, or
say, &lsquo;I did not hear the trumpet,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I did not foresee
war&rsquo;. As Ezechiel said, this is the very reason
why he is seated in his place, that he may sound
the trumpet to others and warn them of coming
troubles. On this account the chastisement is inexorable,
even if only one be lost. For if, when the
sword is brandished, the watchman does not sound
the trumpet to the people, nor signal to them (he
says), and the sword appearing destroys a life, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
life has been lost through the man&rsquo;s own lawlessness,
but I will require his blood at the watchman&rsquo;s hand.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
Cease, then, to push us into that inevitable judgment.
<i>We</i> have to do, not with armies and kingdoms, but
with an action which requires angelical goodness.
The soul of a priest should be purer than the very
rays of the sun, so that the Holy Spirit may never
leave him to himself, that he may be able to say:
<i>I live, not I, but Christ liveth in me</i>. If dwellers in the
desert, who are removed from the cares of city,
market-place, and all that these entail, and are ever
in rest and peace, are unwilling to presume of their
security in such a life, but add numberless cautions,
fortifying themselves on all sides, ardent to do and
to speak with much care, so that they may approach
God as fearlessly and purely as it lies in human
capacity to do, what think you the power and
strength of the priest should be, to enable him to
put off all defilement from his soul and to preserve
spiritual beauty undamaged? For he ought to be
much purer than they, and the more so as he incurs
greater necessities than they, which may sully his
purity, unless by constant watchfulness and strenuous
effort he makes his soul inaccessible to their
influence. Thus, there are fair faces, and luxurious
movements, and a studied walk, and a mincing tone
of voice, and painted eyes, and rouged cheeks, beautiful
plaits, dyed hair, rich clothes, variegated golden
ornaments, fine precious stones, the perfume of scents,
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
and all other things of the kind, dear to the female
sex, which are calculated to upset a soul that is not
armed in the austerity of wisdom. It is no wonder
if a man be troubled by <i>these</i> things; but that
the devil should be able by the contrary things
to wage war against the souls of men and to
wound them,&mdash;<i>this</i> is most surprising and embarrassing.
Already some who have escaped the
former snares have allowed themselves to be taken
by that which was so different. For an unstudied
address, neglected hair, a dirty garment, a disordered
appearance, a careless demeanour, a natural manner,
frank language, an unartificial gait, an artless voice,
a life of poverty, the being despised, and unprotected,
and in solitude, have inspired a man at first with
pity, and from that have led him to utter destruction.
And many who have escaped the former snares, the
snares of gold, and perfume, and clothes, and the
rest which go with them, as I said, have fallen into
these so far removed from those, and have been lost.
Now, when the battle strikes on the spectator&rsquo;s soul,
and weapons of war surround him on all sides,
whether by poverty or by riches, by adornment or
by simplicity, by a studied manner or by unaffectedness,
or in any other of the ways which I have
enumerated, whence is refreshment to come to him
who is thus hemmed in? How are we to meet the
case, not of being taken by force, for this is not so
very difficult, but of keeping our mind in tranquillity
from impure thoughts? I pass over honours, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
are the causes of a thousand evils. Those which
come from women lower the tone of the tempered
mind, and often work ruin whenever a man is not
wholly on his guard against such plottings. And as
to honours coming from men; if they be not received
with much high-mindedness, they involve a man in
two opposite sufferings&mdash;the slavishness of flattery
and the foolishness of boasting. On the one hand,
he is forced to stoop to those who serve him; on the
other, he is puffed up against his inferiors through
these honours of theirs, and thrust into an abyss of
folly. <i>We</i> say this, but the harm of it can only be
properly ascertained by experience. And, necessarily,
things much worse and more dangerous than these
would happen to those who are in the midst of the
fight. The lover of the desert is exempted from all
this, for if a foolish thought <i>did</i> suggest something
of the kind to him, this imagination is weak and
easily overcome, because the flame of the eyes is
not fed by outward things. Now the monk fears
for himself alone: even if he were obliged to think
of others, these would be very few. Or if they
were many, they would be fewer than those in
churches, and give their superior little anxiety, not
through their small numbers alone, but because they
are removed from worldly business, and have neither
children, nor wife, nor anything else of the kind to
trouble about. It is this and the common life which
have made them disposed to obey their rulers. Thus
they are able to see and to correct their faults, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
the constant watchfulness of the teacher is no slight
thing towards increase of virtue. Now, the majority
of men under the priest&rsquo;s charge are taken up with
worldly cares, and this makes them slack in the
fulfilment of their spiritual duties. Hence the
teacher should scatter the seed, so to speak, day by
day, in order that the teaching by constantly falling
should take root in the listener&rsquo;s mind. For superfluous
wealth, and great power, and the softness
arising from luxury, and many other things joined
to these, suffocate the seeds, and often the density of
thorns does not allow the seed to shoot forth so as to
be seen. Moreover, excessive tribulation, the necessities
of poverty, constant reproaches, and everything
else of the kind which is opposed to the former
things, lead a man away from a holy zeal. Not even
the smallest part of sins incurred can become
manifest to them. How should it not be so when
they know not the greater number even by sight?
Thus onerous are a priest&rsquo;s duties towards the
people. But if anyone would consider duties
towards God, he will find the others nothing at all,
so much more careful and diligent a zeal do these
require. For what sort of man should he be who
rules an entire city&mdash;and why do I say a city?&mdash;the
whole world rather&mdash;and has to propitiate God for
the sins of all&mdash;not the sins of the living only, but
those of the dead also. I hold that the courage of
Moses and Elias is all insufficient for this ministry.
Entrusted as if with the world itself, and the father
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
of all, the priest thus approaches God in order to
extinguish wars in every place and to appease strife,
to bring about peace and plenty, and to ask both
privately and publicly a speedy deliverance from the
evils which are pressing upon every man. He himself
ought to be as much above what he asks for as
the ruler should be in everything above the ruled.
Now, what place are we to assign to him when he
calls down the Holy Spirit, and offers up the most
tremendous Sacrifice, and continually holds in his
grasp the common Lord of all? What purity shall
we not expect him to have, what piety? Think
what the hands should be which thus minister!
What the tongue which utters those words! What
should be purer or holier than the soul which
receives so great a Spirit? Then angels surround
the priest, and the sanctuary and all the place about
the Sacrifice are filled with heavenly powers in
honour of Him Who is lying there. And this can
be sufficiently believed from the rites. But I once
heard some one say that an old man, who was held
in veneration and accustomed to revelations, told
him he himself had been made worthy of this vision.
At the time of the sacrifice he had suddenly seen a
multitude of angels, as many as his eye could grasp,
in shining garments surrounding the altar, bending
low, as a man might see soldiers in the presence of
the king, and this I believe. And another man told
me, not what he had learnt from a third person, but
what he himself had been allowed to see and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
hear. This was it. When the departing, who have
chanced to partake of the mysteries with a pure
conscience, draw their last breath, angels, serving
them as a body-guard for the sake of what they have
received, lead them out of this world. Do you not
tremble to come with this soul to this holy sacrifice,
and to be at these solemn rites the man in soiled
garments whom Christ cast out from the rest of the
guests? The soul of the priest should be a light of
justice to the world, but ours is so surrounded with
the darkness of an evil conscience as to be always
overclouded and unable to look fearlessly at its Lord.
Priests are the salt of the earth; who could bear
easily with our folly and our ignorance in everything
if you were not accustomed to give us an exaggerated
love? And it is not enough that he who has been
entrusted with so wonderful a ministry should be
pure; he should also be wise and experienced in
many things; he should know worldly business not
less than those engaged in the midst of it, and still
be further removed from all things than monks in
their desert. As he must come into contact with
men who are married and have children to bring up,
and keep servants and have much wealth, who are
engaged in public business, who are in power, he
should be many-sided. I say many-sided, not a
schemer, neither a flatterer nor a hypocrite, but made
up of much liberality and fortitude, knowing how to
lend a useful hand whenever circumstances demand
it, at once kind and austere. All subjects are not to
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
be used in the same way, since the children of
physicians deem it not good to apply one treatment
to all the sick, nor has the pilot only one course at
his command against the wind. Storms are ever
hanging over <i>this</i> bark, and these storms assail not
only from without, but arise also within, and we
need to have much condescension and much care.
All these things which are different in themselves
have one end in view&mdash;the glory of God and the
strengthening of the Church.</p>

<h3 id="c50"><span class="sc">One Sacrifice.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on Epistle to the Hebrews</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> xvii.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Tell me what need was there of having many
sacrifices when one is sufficient? That there being
many which were constantly offered might show
their inefficacy for purification. Just as a powerful
remedy, which is productive of health and able to
remove all the malady, does everything by one application,
and when this one application does everything,
it shows its strength in not being applied
again; and this is also its work, for if it be always
used it is a sign that it has no efficacy. The merit
of a remedy consists in being applied once and not
often. And so it is here. Why, then, are they
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
always cured by the same sacrifices? If they had
been free from all sin, sacrifices would not have been
offered up every day. Therefore, they were fixed
things, so as to be invariably offered up for all the
people both in the evening and in the morning.
Thus, it was a confession of sins, not a remission of
sins; a confession of weakness, not a manifestation
of strength. Since the first sacrifice availed nothing
the second was offered up, and that also proving
ineffectual another followed, so that it was an
acknowledgment of guilt. On the one hand, the
act of offering was a confession of sin, and the ever-recurring
offering was a confession of weakness.
Now, with Christ it was the contrary. He was
once offered up, and His one oblation sufficed for all
time. He expressed it well by calling them images,
for they present the figure only and not the strength
of the reality. Just as an image represents the likeness
of a man but not his power, so the truth and
the figure have something in common with each
other. The likeness is the same but not the living
power. So it was in the matter of heaven and the
tabernacle. The figure was equal, for it was holy;
but the power and the other qualities were not the
same. What is the meaning of <i>He hath appeared for
the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of Himself</i>?
What is the <i>putting away</i>? Contempt; for sin has no
longer any assurance. It has been put away. How?
Whereas it should have paid a penalty it did not,
that is, force was put upon it; for just when it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
likely to destroy all men it was itself taken away.
<i>He hath been made manifest</i>, he says, <i>by the sacrifice of
Himself</i>; that is, He was manifested to God and went
to God. Now, because the priest did this many
times in the year, do not think that this has taken
place by chance and not through weakness. If not
through weakness, why then did it take place? If
there are no wounds, then neither are remedies
necessary. Therefore, He enjoined that the sacrifice
should be always offered up on account of weakness,
and that it should take place as a commemoration of
sins. What then? Do we not offer up sacrifice day
by day? We do indeed, but we commemorate His
death. This sacrifice is one, not many. How one
and not many? Because it was once offered up,
just as that one sacrifice in the holy of holies. This
is a type of that, and that of the other. We are ever
offering up the same Person. Not one sheep to-day
and another to-morrow, but ever the same sheep, so
that the sacrifice is one. Now, in virtue of this
argument, since the sacrifice is offered up in many
places, are there many Christs? By no means, but
there is everywhere one Christ, as perfect in one
place as in another, one body. Therefore, as He
Who is offered up in many places is one Body and
not many bodies, so is it one Sacrifice. He is our
High Priest Who offered up the sacrifice which
purifies us. This is that which now also we offer
up; the One then offered up, the Inconsumable.
This is done in commemoration of what was then
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
done, for He says, <i>This do in commemoration of Me</i>.
We are ever offering not another sacrifice, as the
high priest then did, but always the same; or rather
we make a commemoration of a sacrifice. And since
I have spoken of this sacrifice, I would say a few
things to you who are initiated, a few things in
volume though possessing great power and help.
What we speak is not ours but the Divine Spirit&rsquo;s.
What, then, is it? Many partake of this sacrifice
once in the whole year, some twice, some often.
Now, we speak to all, not only to those who are here,
but to those who dwell in the desert. For they
receive once a year, often, indeed, once in two years.
Well, then, whom shall we prefer? Those who
receive once, or those who receive twice, or those
who receive often? Neither those who receive once,
nor those who receive often, nor those who receive
seldom, but those who receive with a pure conscience,
and an undefiled heart, and an irreproachable
life. Let such as these ever approach, and
those who are not so not even once. Why?
Because they take judgment to themselves, and
condemnation, and chastisement, and penalty.
Wonder not at this. For just as food, which by
its nature is nourishing, if taken by a diseased
stomach, destroys and withers up everything and
prepares disease, so is it with this case of the
tremendous mysteries. You are partaking of a
spiritual table, of a royal table, and do you again fill
your mouth with mud? You use perfumes, and do
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
you again fill yourself with ill odours? Tell me, I
beseech you, if you receive communion once a year,
will forty days suffice you for the atonement of your
sins during all that time? Again, at the end of a
week perhaps, you return to your former ways.
Now, tell me, if you were to enjoy good health for
forty days after a long illness, and then were to go
back to unwholesome food productive of disease,
would you not waste your trouble? Evidently you
would. If physical things are so changed, how
much more those which belong to the will. Thus
for instance, we see by nature, and we have naturally
a healthy sight. But often our eyes fail from disease.
If, therefore, natural things are so mutable,
how much more that which is a matter of free-will!
You give up forty days to the care of your soul&rsquo;s
health, often not even that, and you think to have
appeased God? You are trifling, man! I say this,
not forbidding you the one communion in the year,
but wishing rather that you should always approach
the holy things. So it is that the deacon raises his
voice to call the holy, and, in doing this, scrutinises
all, so that no one should approach unprepared. As
with a flock of sheep, where many of them are sound
and many are diseased, these latter have to be
separated from the sound ones, so is it in the Church.
Since here, too, some sheep are sound and some
diseased, through this cry which is everywhere heard,
this most awful voice, the priest separates the one
from the other, invites and urges the holy to
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
approach. As, however, man cannot know his
fellow-man&mdash;for <i>what man has known that which is in
man, if not the spirit of man that is in him</i>?&mdash;this cry
he raises after the sacrifice is completed, so that no
one should approach the spiritual fountain negligently
or as if by chance. In the case of the flock&mdash;for
there is no reason why we should not again make
use of the same illustration&mdash;we shut up the sick
ones within the fold, and keep them in a dark place,
and give them different food. We allow them
neither fresh air, nor pure grass, nor water in the
open. Hence that voice is instead of a chain. You
will not be able to say, &lsquo;I was in ignorance of any
danger following upon this act&rsquo;. We have, too, the
special witness of Paul in the matter. But you say,
perhaps, &lsquo;I have not read about it&rsquo;. This is an
accusation rather than an excuse. You are coming
into the church every day and still do not know
these things.</p>

<h3 id="c51"><span class="sc">The new Pasch.</span>
<br />(<i>31st Homily on St. Matthew</i>, lxxxi., vol. ii., p. 459.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and
blessed, and broke, and gave to His disciples, and said:
Take ye and eat: this is My Body. And taking the
chalice, He gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
<i>ye all of this; for this is my Blood of the new testament,
which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.</i>
Consider what great hardness of heart the traitor
showed. Partaking of the mysteries, he remained
the same, and enjoying that most tremendous Banquet,
he was not converted. This Luke plainly
intimates when he says that after these things the
devil entered into him, not despising the Lord&rsquo;s Body,
but scorning the traitor&rsquo;s shamelessness. For his sin
was the greater for two reasons: that he approached
the mysteries with such a mind, and that, approaching
them, he grew no better. Neither fear, nor gratitude,
nor the honour received, had any influence over him.
And although Christ knew all things, He did not
forbid his approach in order to show you that He
leaves no means of conversion untried. Therefore,
both before this and after this, He continued to
exhort and to check Judas both by actions and
words, by fear and by kindness, by threat and by
benefit. But nothing availed against that grievous
sickness of his. Hence, leaving Judas to himself,
He again reminds the disciples through the mysteries
of His death as victim, and during the progress of
the table discourses about the Cross, seeking, by His
insistence in foretelling His passion, to find an entrance
for it in their minds. If, with all that was done and
foretold, they were troubled, what would they have
suffered if they had heard none of these things?
<i>Whilst they were eating, He took bread and broke it.</i>
Why did he carry out this mystery at the time of
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
the Pasch? In order to teach you everywhere that
He is Himself the Lawgiver of the old dispensation,
also, and that its ordinances were made to foreshadow
these things. On this account He adds the reality
to the type. The evening signified the fulness of
time, and the end itself to which things were coming.
He gives thanks, teaching us how we are to carry
out this mystery, and showing us that He goes not
unwillingly to the Cross. And He instructs us that,
whatever we may suffer, we should bear it with
thanksgiving, and opens out from this good hopes
for us. For if the type released men from so grievous
a slavery, how much more will the reality set the
world free, and be bestowed for the blessing of our
nature. For this reason He did not institute this
mystery until the enactments of the Law were to
cease, and He brings to a conclusion the chief of
their feasts by translating them to another and a
most awful Table, and says: <i>Take and eat, this is My
Body which is broken for many</i>. How should they not
have feared when they heard this? He had spoken
to them often and much before on the same subject.
Therefore, He no longer prepares them for
it, for they had heard of it sufficiently; but He tells
them the reason why He suffers&mdash;the remission of
sins. He calls His Blood the Blood of the new
Testament, that is, of the promise, of the gospel,
and of the new law. For this both had been
promised of old, and is the bond of the new Covenant.
And as the old Covenant had sheep and heifers, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
the new Covenant had the Lord&rsquo;s Blood. Then He
goes on to show them that He is about to die, and
therefore He commemorates the Covenant, and
recalls the old Covenant to their minds, for that too
was consecrated through blood! And again He tells
them why He is to die, <i>which is shed for many unto
the remission of sins</i>, and He says: <i>Do this for a commemoration
of Me</i>. Do you see how He leads them
away and withdraws them from Jewish customs. &lsquo;As
you did that,&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;for a commemoration of the
wonders in Egypt, so do this for a commemoration
of Me.&rsquo; That blood was shed to save the first-born
sons: <i>this</i> Blood for the remission of the sins of the
whole world. <i>This is My Blood</i>, He says, <i>which is
shed for the remission of sins</i>. He said this to show
by this also that His sufferings and His cross are a
mystery, and again, to comfort His disciples through
it. And as Moses had said: <i>Let this be to you a
perpetual memorial</i>, so <i>He</i> said, <i>For a commemoration of
Me</i>, until I come. And again, <i>With desire I have
desired to eat this Pasch</i>, that is, &lsquo;to give you the new
gifts, that Pasch by which I intend to make you
spiritual&rsquo;. And He Himself drank of it. In order
that men, hearing this, might not say: &lsquo;How is
this? Are we drinking blood and eating flesh?&rsquo; and
then be troubled (for words of His on this subject
had already disturbed them, and many had been
scandalised by them); to remove, I say, their trouble,
then also He did it first Himself, and led them
gently to a participation of the mysteries. Therefore,
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
He drank His own Blood. &lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; you ask.
&lsquo;Did men of old do it?&rsquo; Certainly not. Therefore,
He says: <i>Do this</i>, that He may draw them away from
the other. For if this work the remission of sins, as
indeed it does, the other is superfluous for the future.
Now, as in the case of the Jews, so was it here. He
bound up the commemoration of the benefit with
the mystery, thereby stopping the mouths of heretics.
For when they say, &lsquo;How do we know that Christ
suffered?&rsquo; amongst other arguments, we silence them
also with the mysteries. If, indeed, Jesus did not die,
what do the things involved in the rites symbolise?</p>

<br />(<i>Homilies on Epistle to the Romans</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> xxxiii., vol. i., p. 489.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>A good teacher makes it his special duty to help
those he is teaching, not by word only, but by prayer
also. Hence Paul&rsquo;s words: <i>Let us give ourselves
continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word</i>.
Who will pray for us now that Paul has departed?
Those who emulate Paul: let us only show ourselves
worthy of so great an advocacy, that we may
not alone hear Paul&rsquo;s voice in this world, but when
we depart hence may deserve to look upon that
soldier of Christ. Or rather, if we listen to him here
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
we are sure to see him there, and if we are not near
to him we shall undoubtedly see him resplendent in
glory close to the King&rsquo;s throne, where the cherubim
give praise, where the seraphim unfold their wings.
There with Peter we shall see Paul, the head and
leader of the choir of the saints, and we shall be in
possession of true charity. For if in this world he
so loved men as when he might have been dissolved
and with Christ he chose to be here, how much
more potently will he show forth the love-charm in
that place. This is why I cherish Rome, although I
have other grounds for my admiration in its size,
and age, and beauty, and population, and power, and
wealth, and its successes in wars; apart from all
these things, I hold it blessed because Paul wrote to
the Romans in his lifetime and loved them so much,
because he spoke to them in person, and there
finished his life. This is why that city is famous
rather than for all other reasons put together: it is
like a strong and beautiful human body with two
shining eyes, which are the bodies of these two
saints. The heavens are not so splendid when the
sun is sending forth its rays as the city of Rome
transmitting these two lights of hers to the whole
world. Rome will yield up Paul; Rome will yield
up Peter. Consider in awe what a sight Rome will
witness when Paul rises in a moment from that
tomb, together with Peter, and is borne away to
meet Christ. Think what roses Rome presents to
Christ, what a double crown surrounds the city, how
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
it is girt with golden chains, and what the fountains
of its being are. This is why I am in admiration at
that city, not for its abundance of gold, not for its
columns, nor for any other beauty it has, but for
these pillars of the Church.</p>
<p>Who could now give me to embrace Paul&rsquo;s body,
to be nailed to his tomb, and to see the dust of him
who completed what was wanting to the sufferings
of Christ, who bore His marks, and sowed the earth
with the Gospel? Who could give me to see the
dust of that body in which he went over the world,
through which Christ spoke, through which a light
shone forth brighter than any lightning, and a voice
arose more terrible to the devils than loudest
thunder, through which he gave utterance to those
blessed words: <i>Would that I could be anathema for my
brethren</i>, which he used before kings and was not
ashamed, through which we have known Paul and
Paul&rsquo;s Lord? We do not dread the thunderbolt as
devils dread that voice. For if they trembled at his
garments, how much more at his voice. This voice
led them in chains, purified the world, cured
diseases, put forth evil, set up truth, had the indwelling
Christ, and with Him made itself everywhere
heard. That voice of Paul&rsquo;s was like the
cherubim. As God took up His seat on those
powers, so did He on the tongue of Paul. It became
worthy to receive Christ, speaking those things
which were dear to Christ, and soaring to an unspeakable
height like the seraphim. For what is
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
beyond those words of his: <i>I am sure that neither
angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor present, nor
future, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall
be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ
Jesus</i>? How many wings does that voice seem to
you to have? How many eyes? Therefore he
said: <i>We are not ignorant of his devices</i>; and so the
devils fled, not merely when they heard his voice,
but when they saw his cloak from a distance.
Would that I could see the dust of this mouth in
which Christ did great and unspeakable things, and
even greater things than by Himself&mdash;for that He
<i>did</i> work greater things by His disciples was
what He said&mdash;through which the Spirit gave those
wonderful oracles to the world. For what good
thing did that mouth not accomplish? It put forth
demons, remitted sins, curbed tyrants, silenced the
tongues of philosophers, led the world to God,
induced barbarians to be ascetic, and changed all
things on earth; nay, in heaven too he did his will,
binding and loosing those whom he chose to bind
and to loose there, according to the power which was
given to him. Would that I could look upon not
only the dust of his mouth, but of that heart, which
we might not wrongly call the heart of the world,
the source of endless good, the beginning, fountainhead
of our own life. From thence the spirit of life
was poured out upon all, and was diffused amongst
the members of Christ. It was sent forth, not
through arteries, but through the free choice of good.
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
That heart was so broad that it could embrace whole
cities, and peoples, and nations. <i>My heart is enlarged</i>,
he says. Yet, large as it was, his all-embracing love
often urged and troubled it. <i>For out of much affliction
and anguish of heart I wrote to you</i>, he says. This
heart, even dissolved in dust, is what I long to see&mdash;the
heart which was consumed for each individual
sinner, suffering afresh the agony of child-birth over
every abortive child, the heart which sees God: <i>For
the clean of heart shall see God</i>: the heart which has
become a sacrifice: <i>An afflicted spirit is a sacrifice to
God</i>: that heart higher than the firmament, wider
than the universe, brighter than sunshine, hotter
than fire, stronger than adamant, giving forth
fruitful streams: <i>For</i>, he says, <i>out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water</i>: hence arose the fresh
spring which watered not the face of the earth, but
the souls of men; hence sprung forth not rivers
alone, but fountains of tears by day and by night:
that heart which lived a new life, not this physical
life of ours: <i>I live</i>, he says, <i>not I, but Christ liveth in
me</i>. So that Paul&rsquo;s heart was His heart&mdash;a tablet
of the Holy Spirit, a book of charity, a heart in
anguish over the sins of men: <i>I am afraid of you</i>, he
says, <i>lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you,
and as the serpent seduced Eve, lest coming I should not
find you as I wish</i>: a heart fearful about itself
whilst full of courage: <i>I am afraid</i>, he says, <i>that
after preaching to others I myself shall be cast out</i>; and,
again: <i>I am sure that neither angels nor archangels shall</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
<i>be able to separate us</i>: the heart which was made
worthy to love Christ as no one else has loved Him,
despising death and hell, and torn by the tears of his
brethren. <i>What are you doing</i>, he says, <i>weeping and
filling my heart with anguish</i>?&mdash;that strongest of
hearts, which could not endure for a moment to be
away from the Thessalonians. Would that I could
see the dust of those fettered hands through which
the imposition of the Spirit was given and the
divine words were written: <i>See what a letter I have
written to you with my own hand</i>; and, again: <i>A
greeting from the hand of Paul</i>, of those hands at
sight of which the viper fell into the fire. Would
that I could look upon the dust of those gloriously-blinded
eyes which saw the light again for the
world&rsquo;s salvation and were made worthy in the body
to behold Christ, and saw earthly things without
seeing them, those eyes which looked upon unseen
things, which knew not sleep, which were watching
in the midst of night, and which did not suffer what
other eyes suffer. Would that I could see the dust
of those feet which toiled over the world and
wearied not, which were chained to a pillory when
he was imprisoned, of those feet which traversed
known and unknown regions and were often on the
way. And why should I speak of each member
separately? Would that I could see that tomb in
which the armour of justice is stored up, the armour
of light, those members which are now in life, which
were dead whilst living, in all of which Christ lived,
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
which were crucified to the world, those members of
Christ which had put on Christ, the temple of the
Spirit, the dwelling-place of holiness, which were
chained to the Spirit and nailed to the fear of God,
bearing the marks of Christ. This is the body
which protects that city and is stronger than any
tower of defence or any number of fortifications, and
with it is that of Peter, whom he honoured in life,
<i>for he went up to consult Peter</i>. In death, therefore,
charity made him worthy to be Peter&rsquo;s companion.
Would that I could see this lion according to the
Spirit. For like a lion breathing fire on troops of
foxes so did he spring upon the tribe of devils and
philosophers and fall like a heavy thunderbolt upon the
devil&rsquo;s ranks. Nor did the devil stand against Paul
in battle, but so great was his fear and trembling
that he retreated from his shadow or his voice. So
it was that, being far off, Paul gave the fornicator up
to him and again snatched him from his hands, and so
he did others too, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
Consider how he ranges against the foe those
who are under his own command, rousing and spurring
them on. Thus, when he said to the Ephesians,
<i>Our warfare is not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities and powers</i>, he added the reward also, by
the words <i>in heavenly things</i>. <i>For</i>, he said, <i>our warfare
is not for earthly things, but for heaven and heavenly
things</i>. And to others his words were: <i>Know you not
that we shall judge angels, how much more things of this
world?</i> Taking all this to heart, let us stand bravely.
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
For Paul was also a man and of the same nature as
we are, having everything else in common with us;
but because he showed a great love for Christ he
scaled the heavens and found his place with the
angels. If, then, we wish to rouse ourselves a little
and to kindle that fire within us, we should emulate
that holy one. He tells us himself that this is not
impossible: <i>Be imitators of me as I am of Christ</i>.
Therefore let us not only admire him and wonder at
him, let us also imitate him, that at our departure
hence we may be made worthy to see him and to
share that unspeakable glory. May this be granted
to all of us through the grace and love of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, to Whom, with the Father and the
Holy Ghost, be praise for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<br />(<i>1st Homily on the Betrayal of Judas</i>, <i>Benedictine Edition</i>, t. ii., p. 381.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Then the disciples came to Him. <i>Then.</i> When?
When these things were taking place, and the betrayal
was effected, and Judas destroyed himself, the
disciples came to Him, saying, <i>Where wilt Thou that
we prepare to eat the Pasch</i>? Mark you the difference
between disciple and disciples? The one betrays
his Lord, the others busy themselves with preparing
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
the Pasch; the one makes a bargain, the others
minister for His table: both the one and the others
had enjoyed the same miracles, the same teaching,
the same authority. Now, how do they differ? In
the will: this is everywhere the cause, both of all
good and all evil. <i>Where wilt Thou that we prepare to
eat the Pasch?</i> <i>Then</i> was that same evening. As Our
Lord had no house of His own, they said to Him,
<i>Where wilt Thou that we prepare to eat the Pasch?</i> We
have no settled dwelling-place, neither tent nor
house. Let those who dwell in splendid houses, and
spacious courts, and large precincts be taught that
Christ had not where to lay His head. Therefore
they asked, <i>Where wilt Thou that we prepare to eat the
Pasch?</i> What Pasch? This was not our Pasch, but
still the Jews&rsquo; Pasch; it was this Jewish Pasch which
<i>they</i> prepared; Our Lord Himself prepared ours.
Not only did He prepare it Himself, but He became
our Pasch. <i>Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee
to eat the Pasch?</i> This was the Jewish Pasch which had
begun in Egypt. Now, why did Christ partake of it?
Because He accomplished all the observances of the
law. At His baptism He said: <i>Thus it becomes us to
fulfil all justice</i>. I came to redeem man from the
malediction of the law. For God sent His own Son,
made of woman, made under the law, that He might
redeem those who were bound by it, and might put
an end to the law. Now, to prevent anyone from
saying that He abolished the law because He was
unable to fulfil it, as being burdensome, and hard,
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
and oppressive, having first Himself carried it out,
He then dissolved it. On this account He held the
Pasch also, for the Pasch was an ordinance of the law.
And why did the law order the eating of the Pasch?
The Jews were ungrateful towards their benefactor,
and so immediately after the benefits they forgot
God&rsquo;s precepts. When they came out of Egypt, and
saw the waters parted, and again closed, and a
thousand other wonders, they said, <i>Let us make to
ourselves gods who may go before us</i>. What say you?
You still touch the wonders with your hands, and
have you forgotten the benefactor? Since, therefore,
they were thus without feeling or understanding,
God kept alive the memory of His gifts by the ordinance
of feasts, and He commanded the Pasch to be
sacrificed, so that if your son ask you, &lsquo;What is this
Pasch?&rsquo; you may answer, &lsquo;Our forefathers in Egypt
sprinkled their doors with the blood of the lamb,
lest the angel of destruction, when he came, should
enter in and smite with the plague&rsquo;. Thus the feast
was a perpetual memorial of salvation. Moreover,
not only did these feasts benefit them by keeping
fresh the memory of graces in the past, but something
much more, for they foreshadowed what was to come.
That lamb, indeed, was the figure of another Lamb,
a spiritual Lamb, and that sheep of another Sheep.
The one was a shadow, the other the reality. When
the Sun of Justice appeared, the shadow forthwith
ceased, for at sunrise the shadows depart. Consequently,
at that table itself, each Pasch takes place&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
Pasch of the figure and the Pasch of the reality.
Just as painters use one and the same canvas for
outlining their subject and depicting shadow, and
then add colouring to make it life-like, so did Christ
act. At one and the same table He showed forth
the typical Pasch, and set up the true Pasch. <i>Where
wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Pasch?</i> It
was then the Jewish Pasch, but when the sun
appears let the lamp be extinguished; with the
advent of truth let the shadow languish.</p>
<p>I say these things to the Jews since they seem to
celebrate a Pasch, since the uncircumcised in heart
put forward their unleavened bread with a gross
mind. Tell me, O Jew, how do you sacrifice the
Pasch? The temple is destroyed, the altar has been
taken away, the holy of holies has been trampled
under foot, all show of sacrifice has ceased. Wherefore,
then, do you venture to carry out practices so
illegal? You went out once into Babylon, and there
those who had taken you captive said, <i>Sing us a song
of Sion</i>, and you would not. And David spoke with
the same intent: <i>We sat beside the waters of Babylon and
wept; we hung up our organs on the willows in the midst
of it</i>, that is, our instruments, harps, lyres, and the
rest. Men of old used these things, and thus sung
hymns, and when they went into captivity took them
so as to have a reminder of their life in their own
country, not to use them. <i>For there</i>, he says, <i>they who
held us captive asked us for words of songs, and we said,
How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land?</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
What! you will not sing the song of the Lord in a
strange land, and yet will you celebrate the Pasch of
the Lord in a strange land! What ingratitude and
iniquity! Because those who constrained them were
enemies, they dared not even sing a psalm in a
strange land. And now of themselves, whereas no
man puts force upon them, they wage war against
God. Do you see how their unleavened bread is unclean
and their feast illegal? Now there is no
Jewish Pasch. There was one then, but it is dissolved
now, and the spiritual Pasch came, which was
given then by Christ. For as they were eating and
drinking, the Evangelist says, taking bread, He broke
and said: <i>This is My body, which is broken for you unto
the remission of sins</i>. The initiated understand these
words. Then, taking the chalice, He said: <i>This is
My Blood, which is shed for many unto the remission of
sins</i>. And Judas was present as Christ spoke thus.
This is the very Body which you have sold for thirty
pieces of silver, O Judas; this is the very Blood
which you have just shamefully bartered to the unfeeling
Pharisees. O loving kindness of Christ! O
foolish madness of Judas! On the one hand Judas
sold Him for thirty pieces of silver, whilst Christ even
after this did not refuse to give that Blood, which
had been betrayed, to the traitor for the remission of
his sins, if he had so willed. And Judas was there,
and he partook of the sacred table. For, as Our
Lord had washed his feet, together with the other
disciples&rsquo;, so did he eat with them of the sacred
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
table, in order that he might have no excuse for
remaining obdurate. Our Lord did everything in
His power, yet Judas persisted in his wickedness.</p>
<p>But it is now time for us to approach that
tremendous table. Let us, therefore, all go to it
with becoming sobriety and watchfulness. Let
there be no Judas here, no guilty man, no one infected
with poison, no man with one thing in his
mouth and another in his mind. The same Christ
is now here Who prepared that table. And He it
is Who is now preparing it. For it is not a man
who makes the offerings become the Body and Blood
of Christ, but the very Christ for us crucified.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>
Fulfilling what he represents, the priest stands there,
speaking those words; the power and grace of them
are God&rsquo;s. <i>This is My Body</i>, he says, and this word
transforms what lies before him;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> and just as the
words, <i>Increase and multiply and fill the earth</i>, were
once spoken and endue our nature through all time
with fruitfulness, so those other words once spoken
from that time till to-day and until His coming,
make the sacrifice over each table in the churches
complete. Therefore, let no hypocrite approach, no
one filled with sin, no one with poison in his mind,
that he may not receive judgment to himself, for then,
too, Judas had partaken of the oblation when the
devil leapt into him; not that the devil despised the
Lord&rsquo;s Body, but Judas for his shameful conduct.
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
This was to teach you that the devil continually
attacks and assails those who unworthily partake of
the divine mysteries, as he did Judas. For honourable
things profit the good, but inflict a greater
punishment on those who abuse the use of them.
I say this not to terrify but to fortify you. Let there
be no Judas, then; let no one enter in poisoned with
evil. For the sacrifice is spiritual food; and just as
bodily food, when received by a stomach which has
bad humours, strengthens disease, not from its own
nature but because of that stomach&rsquo;s weakness, so
does it usually happen with the spiritual mysteries.
They, too, when received by a soul full of wickedness,
wither it up and corrupt it the more, not by
their own nature, but through the weakness of the
participating soul. Let no one, therefore, indulge
in bad thoughts; let us rather cleanse our mind, for
we are approaching an immaculate sacrifice; let us
make our souls holy. This may be done even in
one day. How? If you have anything against an
enemy cast out your anger, cure your wound, give
up your enmity, in order that you may receive a
healing from that table, for you are approaching a
tremendous and all-holy sacrifice. Reverence the
reason which prompts this offering. Christ lies slain
before you. Why was He slain, and on what account?
That He might bring about peace between
the things of heaven and the things of earth; that
He might make you the friend of angels, and reconcile
you to the God of all; and that, whereas you
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
were a foe and an enemy, He might transform you
into His friend. <i>He</i> gave up His own life for those
who hated Him. <i>You</i> continue in enmity with your
fellow-servant, and how will you be able to approach
the table of peace? He did not refuse even to die
for you. Will you not put away for your own sake
your anger against your fellow-servant? What
excuse has this conduct? &lsquo;He has treated me
badly,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;and has been most grasping.&rsquo;
What is this? It was a sheer money loss, but he
was far from wounding you as Judas did Our Lord.
Yet <i>He</i> gave that very blood which poured from
Him for the salvation of those who shed it. What
have you to put against this? If you do not forgive
your enemy you have wounded not him but yourself.
You have often done him some harm in this life, but
you have prepared for yourself a relentless sentence
in the enduring day of eternity. For nothing is so
hateful to God as a revengeful man, an unforgiving
heart, and an angered mind. Listen to what He
says: <i>When thou offerest thy gift at the altar, and as
thou standest there, rememberest that thy brother hath
anything against thee, take thy gift from the altar, and
going away, be reconciled to thy brother, and then offer
thy gift</i>. What? Do you tell me that I must forgive?
&lsquo;I do, indeed,&rsquo; He says; &lsquo;this sacrifice was
instituted in order that you and your brother should
be at peace.&rsquo; If, therefore, it was instituted that
you might be at peace with your brother, and you do
not enjoy peace, it is idle for you to take part in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
sacrifice, and it has been instituted in vain as far as
you are concerned. Do, then, in the first place, that
for which the sacrifice is offered, and then you will
enjoy its full benefit. The Son of God came down
from heaven that He might reconcile our nature to
its Lord, and on this account not only did He come,
but wished also to make us who should do the same
things participators of His Name. <i>Blessed are the
peacemakers</i>, He says, <i>for they shall be called the sons of
God</i>. That which the only begotten Son of God
did, do you also according to your human power, by
becoming a bond of peace to yourself and to others.
This is why He calls you who are a peacemaker a
son of God; this is why, in the time of sacrifice, He
is mindful of no other commandment than that of
reconciliation with a brother, showing that it is the
greatest of all. Would that I could go on with the
argument, but what I have said is sufficient for those
who are here present, if they will lay it to heart.
Let us always be mindful of these words, beloved
brethren, and of the holy kiss of peace, and of the
most sacred embrace which we give to each other.
For this it is which holds our minds together, and
makes us all one body, since we all partake of one
Body. Let us then blend ourselves into one body,
not mixing our bodies, but uniting our souls in the
bond of charity; thus we shall be able to enjoy the
table set before us with confidence. For even if we
should be righteous a thousand times over, and yet
have revengeful spirits, all is vanity and deception,
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
and we shall be powerless to gain fruits of salvation
here. Recognising this, let us put off all anger,
and, purifying our conscience, let us with all meekness
and humility approach the table of Christ, to
Whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be
all glory, honour, and power, now and for ever!
Amen.</p>
<h3 id="c54"><span class="sc">The Union of the Holy Eucharist.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on St. Matthew</i>, lxxxii., vol. ii., p. 468.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let us then trust in God under all circumstances,
and never gainsay Him, even when what He says
seems contrary to our reasonings and to our sight;
but let His word be more powerful than our reasoning
and our sight. So let us act in regard to the
mysteries, not seeing only that which is before us,
but also embracing His words. <i>His</i> word is not to
be set aside, whereas our senses are easily deceived.
<i>It</i> has never failed, but our senses have
erred over and over again. Since, then, the word
is, <i>This is My Body</i>, let us trust and believe in it,
and gaze at it with our mind&rsquo;s eyes. For Christ
delivered to us nothing that is the object of sense,
but objects all of the mind, yet dealing with sensible
things. Thus, too, in baptism, the gift is made
through an object of sense&mdash;the water, and that
which is accomplished, is an object of mind, viz.,
birth and renewal. For, if you were bodiless, He
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
would have given you bodiless gifts in their nakedness;
but, since the soul is encompassed by the
body, He gives you objects of mind, under the appearance
of sensible things. How many men say,
&lsquo;I should like to see His form and features, His
garments and His shoes? Well, you see Him, and
touch Him, and eat Him. You desire to see what
He wore, and He gives you Himself, not to see only,
but to touch, and to eat, and to receive within you.
Therefore, let no man approach with disgust or
carelessness, but all with fire, and zeal, and watchfulness.
For, if the Jews ate their Pasch in haste,
standing, and holding their sandals and staffs in
their hands, how much more should you be wary.
<i>They</i> were about to go out to Palestine, and so they
had the outward signs of travellers, and <i>you</i> are going
forth to heaven. Hence we must be ever on the
watch, for not a small punishment is reserved to
those who eat unworthily. Think what your anger
is against the traitor, and those who crucified Him,
and see if you are not yourself guilty of the Body
and Blood of Christ. They slaughtered the all-holy
Body, and you receive it with a foul soul after so
many loving benefits. He deemed it not sufficient to
become man, to be scourged, and put to death, He
also blends Himself with us, not by faith only, but
in very deed makes us His Body. What, then,
should be the purity of him who partakes of this
sacrifice? How spotlessly white should not the hand
be which divides this Flesh, or the mouth which is
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
filled with spiritual fire, or the tongue which is
purpled with that tremendous Blood? Consider
what honour has been shown to you, and what that
feast is which you enjoy. The angels gaze and
tremble, and dare not look back again, because of
the lightning which flashes from it; and this is
what we feed upon, this is blended with us, and we
ourselves become one body and one flesh with
Christ. <i>Who shall declare the powers of the Lord?
Who shall set forth all His praises?</i> Where is the
shepherd who feeds his sheep with his own members?
And why do I talk of a shepherd? There
are many mothers who, after the pains of childbirth,
give up their children to be nursed by
others. This He would not suffer, but He Himself
feeds us with His own Blood, and in everything
unites us to Himself. For consider: He
was born of our substance. &lsquo;Not for all men,&rsquo; you
say. Yes, for all. For, if He came to our nature,
it is evident that He came to all, and if He came to
all, then He came to each one of us. And why is it,
you ask, that all men have not profited by this gift?
This was not the fault of Him Who took that
nature for all, but of those who had not the will.
He unites Himself to each one of the faithful,
through the mysteries, and those whom He brought
forth He rears through Himself, and gives Himself
to no other, persuading you again thereby that it
was that very flesh of yours which He took. Therefore,
let us not grow negligent who have been made
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
worthy of so great charity and honour. Do you not
see how eagerly babies grasp their mother&rsquo;s breast,
and how they press their lips upon it. Just so let
<i>us</i> approach this table and the breast of spiritual
drink; or rather, with much more impatience, let us
draw near to the kindness of the Spirit, as children
to their mother&rsquo;s breast, and let us know one only
pain, that of not participating in this food. That
which lies before us is no work of human power.
He Who did these things at that supper is He Who
is now doing them. Our part is to furnish the ranks
of servers. He Who sanctifies and prepares these
gifts is Himself. Therefore let there be no Judas,
no money-lover. If a man be not a disciple, let him
withdraw: this table is not prepared for such as he.
<i>I will eat the Pasch</i>, He says, <i>with My disciples</i>. This
is that same table, and it offers no less. It was not
that Christ instituted the one and a man the other,
but He instituted both one and the other. This is
that upper chamber in which they were assembled;
thence they went forth into the Garden of Olives.
Let us also go forth to minister to the poor, for
this is our mountain of olives. The multitude of
the poor, who are planted in God&rsquo;s house, are olives,
dropping upon us the oil that is to be useful to us,
which the five virgins had, and the five who did not
take it perished for want of it. Possessing it, let us go
in, that we may all meet the Bridegroom, with bright
lamps: with it, let us go forth from this world.</p>

<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, xxiv., vol. ii., pp. 287, 295.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p><i>The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the
communion of the Blood of Christ?</i> What do you say,
blessed Paul? Wishing to engage your hearers&rsquo;
attention and commemorating the tremendous
mysteries, do you call that awful and most
tremendous chalice a chalice of benediction? &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;since what I have said is no slight thing.
For when I speak of benediction I speak of the
Eucharist, and when I speak of the Eucharist I
unfold all the treasure of God&rsquo;s munificence and
commemorate His greatest gifts.&rsquo; And we, recounting
over the chalice the unspeakable benefits of God
and what mercies we have enjoyed, thus worship
Him and hold communion with Him, giving thanks
that He has freed the human race from error, that
whereas we were far off from Him He drew us near,
that when we were without hope and without God
in the world He made us His brethren and co-heirs.
Thus, in thanking Him for these and all His gifts,
we approach Him. How, then, O Corinthians, are
you not doing the opposite to this when praising
God for turning you away from idols you hasten
back to their tables? <i>Is not the chalice of benediction
which we bless the communion of the Blood of Christ?</i> He
spoke these words with an awful assurance. For
this is what he says: that which is in the chalice is
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
what flowed from His side, and of that we partake.
But He called it a chalice of thanksgiving, since we,
holding it in our hands, thus praise Him, wondering
and being overwhelmed with this ineffable gift,
magnifying Him for pouring out this very Blood of
His that we might not remain in error, and not only
that He poured it out, but that He has given to each
one of us to partake of it. So, He says, if you desire
blood, do not dye the altar of idols with the slaughter
of unreasoning animals, but dye My altar with <i>My</i>
Blood.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
Tell me what is more tremendous, what is
tenderer than this? For this is what lovers do:
when they see the loved ones longing for what others
have and despising what they themselves have, they
give their own gifts, and so induce the beloved to
turn away from the things of others. But lovers
show this affection of theirs by money, and clothes,
and chattels, no one of them ever by his blood; yet
Christ gave us even this proof of His solicitude and
His burning love for us. Thus, in the old Law, as
men were in an imperfect state and offered blood to
idols, it remained for Him to receive this (the
chalice of the Pasch) that He might turn them away
from idols, which, again, was an ineffable tenderness.
But here He led them up to a far more awful and
magnificent worship of God, and changed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
sacrifice itself, and instead of the slaughtering of
unreasoning animals, He commanded them to offer
up Himself. <i>Is not the bread which we break the communion
of the Body of Christ?</i> Why did he not say a
participation? Because he wished to set forth
something more and to show the closeness of that
union. For we communicate not only by receiving
and participating, but by being made one with Him.
For just as that body is united to Christ, so are we
made one with Him through this bread. Why did
he add, <i>which we break</i>? This is seen to take place
in the case of the Eucharist, though not at the
Cross, but the contrary. <i>Not a bone of Him shall be
broken</i>, the Scripture says. That which He did not
suffer on the cross He suffers in the Eucharist for
your sake, and He endures being broken that He
may fill all.</p>
<p>Then after saying <i>the communion of the body</i>&mdash;for that
which communicates is something distinct from the
thing communicated&mdash;he removed even this seemingly
slight difference. For in the words <i>communion
of the body</i> he sought to say something closer, and
therefore added, <i>That we, being many, are one bread
and one body</i>. &lsquo;Why do I speak of communion?&rsquo; he
says; &lsquo;we are that very Body itself. For what is
the bread? The Body of Christ. What do partakers
of it become? The Body of Christ: not
many bodies, but one body.&rsquo; Just as bread is
composed of many grains of wheat which are
nowhere apparent in it, but still there, presenting no
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
difference by reason of the kneading, so are we
joined together with each other and with Christ.
You are not nourished by one body and another man
by another, but all by the same; therefore he added,
&lsquo;We are all participators of the same bread&rsquo;. But if
we <i>are</i> of the same, and become the same, why do
we not all show forth the same charity and become
one in this respect also? For this was so formerly
in our progenitors. <i>There was one heart and one mind
in the gathering of the faithful.</i> This is not the case
now, but very much the reverse. Dissensions are
many and various and well-nigh everywhere, and we
show ourselves fiercer than wild beasts towards our
members. Christ united you to Himself when you
were so distant, and you will not deign to be united
with your brother as you ought to be, but thrust
yourself away from him, whilst enjoying so great a
love and life from your Master. It was not for no
purpose that He gave His Body, but as the first human
nature, which was made from the earth, became by
sin subject to death and to be deprived of life, He
introduced, as we might say, another bread and
leaven&mdash;His own Flesh&mdash;in nature, indeed the
same, but free from sin and full of life; and He
gave to all men to eat of it, that, nourished by
it and putting off the old dead nature, we may at
this table be blended with the living and immortal
nature.</p>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>This Body He gave to us to take and eat, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
was an act of exceeding love.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> For it often happens
that we bite those whom we love. Thus, when
Job pointed out the affection of his household for
himself, he quoted those who loved him specially
as often saying, <i>Who will give us to be filled with his
flesh?</i> So it is that Christ has given us to be filled
with His Flesh, drawing us to greater love. Let us,
therefore, approach Him with fervour and burning
love, that we may not encounter the harder chastisement.
For the more we are benefitted, the greater
will be our punishment whenever we show ourselves
unworthy of His generosity. This Body, even lying
in the manger, the Magi reverenced: untutored and
uncivilised men, leaving their country and their
home, undertook a long journey, they came and
adored, full of awe and fear. Let us, citizens of
heaven, emulate even uncivilised men, if necessary.
<i>They</i>, seeing Him in a manger, and in a hut, and not
seeing Him as you see Him, approached Him with
deep reverence: you see Him not in the crib,
but on the altar: you see Him not held by a woman,
but the priest standing there, and the Spirit hovering
with abundant blessings over what is lying there.
Nor do you merely see this Body as they did: <i>you</i>
know His power and all the economy of His providence,
nor are you ignorant of anything accomplished
through Him, initiated as you are into all His
mysteries. Let us therefore rouse ourselves, and
tremble, and show forth so much the greater reverence
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
than those men from afar, in order that we
may not approach Him heedlessly or casually, and
so heap coals of fire upon our heads. This I say,
not that we may not approach Him, but that we may
not approach Him carelessly. For just as going to
Him in a chance way is a danger, so the non-participation
in that mystical Banquet is hunger and death.
This Feast is the sinew of our soul, the bond of
intellect, the basis of fortitude; it is hope, salvation,
light, life. With this sacrifice, at our departure
from this world to the next, we shall pass through
those sacred portals in great fearlessness, as if encompassed
with an armour of gold. And why do I speak
of the future? Even here this mystery makes the
earth a heaven for you. At least unfold the gates of
heaven and look through them, or rather not only
the gates of heaven, but of the heaven of heavens,
and then you will see what I say. For that which
is the most precious of all things there, is what I
will show you lying on earth. Just as in royal
palaces it is not the walls which strike men with
the most awe, nor the golden ceilings, but the person
of the king sitting on his throne, so in heaven is it
the King&rsquo;s Body. Yet this is what you may now
see on earth. I am showing you not angels, nor
archangels, nor the heavens, nor the heaven of
heavens, but the Lord of all these Himself. Do you
understand how it is that you see the most precious
thing of all upon earth? And not only do you see
it, but you also touch it? And not only touch it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
but you eat it, and, receiving it, you take it away
with you? Cleanse, therefore, your soul; prepare
your mind for the reception of these mysteries. If,
now, you were judged worthy to carry a royal child
in state, with his kingly robes and his diadem, you
would give up everything on earth for it. And,
here, receiving not a royal child of man, but the very
only begotten Son of God, tell me, do you not tremble,
and renounce the love of all earthly things, and adorn
yourself only for that world to come, or have you
still your eyes fixed on the earth, do you still love
money, and anxiously crave for gold? What pardon
could you look for, or what excuse would you have?
Know you not how Our Lord turns His back upon
all worldly luxury? Was not this His reason for
being born and laid in a manger, and for choosing a
mother who was poor? Was it not for this that He
said to the man who looked to worldly traffic: <i>The
Son of man has not whereon to lay His head</i>? And
what of His disciples? Did not they carry out the
same law, lodging at the houses of the poor, one
going to a tanner&rsquo;s, another to a tent-maker&rsquo;s,
another to the woman selling purple? They did
not seek for illustrious houses, but for upright
minds. Let us then emulate their example; looking
beyond the beauty of pillars and marbles, seeking
only for the mansions above, let us trample under
foot all vanities here below, together with the lust
for money, and take up a lofty mind. For if we
be sober and watchful, the world itself will not be
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
worthy of us, much less the Stoic portico or the Peripatetic
walk. Therefore, I repeat, let us adorn our souls,
let us prepare this dwelling-place, which we shall take
with us when we depart, so that we may possess the
eternal tents through the grace and love of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>
<h3 id="c56"><span class="sc">Remembrance of the Dead.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on Epistle to the Philippians</i>, iv., vol. v., p. 36.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Let us, then, not simply grieve for the dead, nor
simply rejoice in the living. Then what shall we
do? Let us grieve for sinners not when dead alone,
but when living also; and let us be glad over the
just not in their lifetime only, but when they have
departed hence. Sinners even living are dead, whilst
the just, who are dead, live: sinners are an object of
pity to all men even here because they have quarrelled
with God, so are the just blessed in that place, since
they have gone to Christ. Sinners, wherever they
are, are far from the King, and therefore deserve
tears, but the just, whether here or there, are with
the King; <i>there</i> they are more with Him and nearer
to Him, not by their going in, nor by faith, but face
to face. Let us, then, not weep simply for the dead
but for those in sin: these call for tears, for lamentation
and weeping. For, tell me, what hope is there
of those who depart in sins to that place where sins
are not put off? As long as they were here, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
probability was great that they might be converted
and become better. But if they go to the other
world, there is nothing to be gained from contrition.
<i>In hell</i>, he says, <i>who shall give praise to Thee</i>? Let us
weep for those who thus depart. I do not forbid it,
only not in an unseemly fashion, not plucking out
our hair, nor baring our arms, nor tearing our face,
nor wearing black, but only in shedding a bitter tear
according to the spirit in secret. Without these
accompaniments we may weep bitterly, and not be
contented with a show, for what some people have
done differs in nothing from a show. For instance,
those who beat themselves at the market-place do it
not from sympathy, but for display and for self-seeking
and vainglory, and many women so treat themselves
as a business speculation. Weep bitterly, groan at
home when no one is looking: this is sympathy, and
this will be helpful to you also. For, in grieving for
another, you will be all the more zealous never to
fall in the same way, and you will tremble at sin
ever afterwards. Weep for unbelievers, for those
who are not different from unbelievers, who depart
hence without baptism, without being signed with
the seal: these should have tears and wailings, they
are outside the royal palace with those awaiting
judgment and with the condemned. <i>Amen, I say to
you, unless a man be born of water and the Spirit, he
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i> Weep for
those who have died in riches, and have devised no
comfort for their own souls out of their wealth, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
have received power to wash away their sins, and
have not willed to do it. Weep all of you for these
both in secret and in public, but with decorum and
reverence, not making a show of yourselves. Let us
shed tears over these not for one day, nor two, but
during our whole life. This is no foolish weeping,
but the weeping of affection; the other is senseless,
and therefore it soon spends itself. Grief which is
born of the fear of God endures for ever. Let us
weep for these and help them as much as we can.
Let us devise some succour for them; it may be a
slight thing, but let us somehow do it. How and
in what manner? By praying and inviting others to
pray for them, by constantly giving alms to the poor
for them. This deed has its consolation. Listen to
God&rsquo;s words: <i>I will protect this city for Myself and for
David, My servant</i>. If the mere remembrance of a
just man could do so much, what will works done
for him not be able to accomplish? Not in vain
was it ordained by the Apostles that the dead should
be commemorated at the tremendous mysteries:
they knew what a great gain and benefit it would be
to the dead. For when a whole people stands with
uplifted hands in full and sacred assembly, and the
awful sacrifice is lying before us, how shall we not
reach God in our prayer for them? But this applies
to those who have died in the faith. With regard to
catechumens they are not deemed worthy of this
consolation; they lack all such succour, save in one
particular. What is this? We may give alms for
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
them to the poor, and the action brings them a certain
refreshment, because God wills us to be of use
to each other. For why did He command us to
pray for the peace and well-being of the world, or,
again, for all men? Although there are thieves, and
tomb-despoilers, and plunderers, and men full of
every sort of evil amongst the whole number, yet we
still pray for them all. Perhaps there may be a conversion
of some. Now, as we pray for the living
who do not differ from the dead, so we may pray for
the departed. Job offered sacrifices for his children,
and freed them from their sins. <i>Lest perhaps</i>, he said,
<i>they have sinned in their hearts</i>. Thus is a man provident
for his children. He did not say, as the
multitude of men <i>do</i> say, &lsquo;I will leave them possessions,&rsquo;
nor a fine name, nor, &lsquo;I will buy an office,&rsquo; nor
fields, but what, <i>Lest perhaps they have sinned in their
hearts</i>. For what is the profit of those things?
None, of things that remain here below. <i>I will make</i>,
he says, <i>the King of all propitious to them: and then nothing
is wanting to them</i>. <i>The Lord is my Shepherd, and
I shall lack for nothing.</i> Here are great riches, here
are treasures. If we have the fear of God we want
nothing, but without it, even if we have a kingdom,
we are the poorest of men. A God-fearing man has
no equal. The fear of the Lord exceeds all things.
This let us possess, and let us do all things unto this
end: even if we have to give up our life, or our body
to be cut in pieces, let us not fear: let us do all our
actions in order to gain this fear. Thus shall we
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
become richer than all, and arrive at the goods to
come in Christ Jesus Our Lord, to Whom, with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, be honour, power, and
glory, now and for ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 id="c57"><span class="sc">The Departed at the Sacred Mysteries.</span>
<br />(<i>Homilies on First Epistle to Corinthians</i>, xli., vol. ii., p. 524.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Since, then, we are to enjoy goods so great, let us
join ourselves to that company which is as bright as
the sun, and let us not weep for those who depart
hence, but for those who make a bad end. For, as
the husbandman does not grieve over his seed dissolved,
but is in fear and anxiety as long as it
remains solid, so he rejoices when he sees that it <i>is</i>
dissolved. For dissolution is the beginning of the
future generating. So let us also rejoice when the
corruptible habitation perishes, and man is generated.
And wonder not if Paul called the burying a generating,
for this is the better generating of the two.
Death, labours, dangers, cares, succeed the one;
whilst for the other, if we have lived righteously, we
receive crowns and rewards: corruption and death
succeed the one; incorruption, immortality, and a
thousand goods succeed the other. In the one
generating there is embracing, pleasure, sleep; in
the other there is only the voice coming down from
heaven, and all things accomplished in the twinkling
of an eye. And he who rises is no more driven to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
laborious life, but he will be where pain and sorrow
and lamentation have fled away. If, however, you
are seeking for a protector, and weep over the man
on this account, fly for refuge to God, the common
Protector, and Saviour, and Benefactor of all: to
the almighty Friend, to the never-failing Succour, to
the lasting Shelter, Who is everywhere and always
holding us up. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;the intercourse was
pleasant and fascinating.&rsquo; I know it was. Still, if
you meet your suffering with your reason, and consider
in yourself who it is that has taken him, and
that if you bear it bravely, you offer up your wish as
a sacrifice to God, you will be borne aloft even over
this wave, and Christian principle will effect what
the action of time does; but if you are pusillanimous,
time will weaken your passion without bringing you a
reward. Together with these recollections, ponder on
the examples offered both in this present life and in
Holy Scripture. Consider how Abraham slaughtered
his own son, neither shedding tears nor uttering a
bitter word. &lsquo;But <i>he</i> was Abraham,&rsquo; you say. Yet
you are called to greater conflicts. Job, indeed,
showed sorrow as a loving father would who mourns
over those departing from him. Now <i>we</i> show the
grief of foes and enemies. For if a man were summoned
to a palace and crowned, and you were to
beat your breast and be in sorrow at it, I should say
you were not a friend to the man crowned, but a
determined adversary and hater. &lsquo;I am not weeping
for him,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;but for myself.&rsquo; Neither is
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
this the part of a lover&mdash;the wishing him to be still
in conflict on your account, to be left in uncertainty
as to the future, instead of being crowned, or to be
tossing on the sea when he might be resting in harbour.
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;I know not where he has
gone.&rsquo; How is it that you do not know? This will
be evident from the fact of his having lived righteously
or the reverse. &lsquo;And as he departed in sin, this is
the very reason why I am tormented.&rsquo; What you
say is a mere pretext. If this is why you mourn
over a dead man, you should have taken pains with
the living one and set him right. You are throughout
thinking of your own interests, not of his. If,
indeed, he departed hence in sin, you should rejoice
that his sins were stopped and that he did not continue
in evil, and you should help him by those means
which are in your power: not by tears, but by
prayers, and supplications, and alms-giving, and offerings.
It is not by chance that these things have
been ordered, nor is it due to haphazard that we
commemorate the dead at the sacred mysteries, and
that we succour them by supplication to the Lamb,
Who is lying there, Who takes away the sins of the
world, but that they may derive hence some consolation.
Nor is it without reason that he who is
standing by the altar, as the sacred mysteries are
performed, utters this cry: for all those who have
fallen asleep in Christ, and for those who make commemoration
in their behalf. For if commemoration
were not made for them, this would not be said.
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
Our mysteries are no theatrical display. God forbid!
These things take place by the disposition of the
Spirit. Therefore, let us help them, and make commemoration
in their behalf. For if Job&rsquo;s sacrifice
purified his children, why do you doubt that the departed
receive comfort when we too offer sacrifice
for them? God is wont to give graces to some on
behalf of others. And this Paul also showed, saying
<i>that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many
persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf</i>.
Let us not weary of helping the departed, both by
offering sacrifice and claiming intercession for them.
For the sacrifice which saves the whole world is
before us. Therefore we pray confidently at it for
what concerns the world, and we name them with
martyrs, and confessors, and pontiffs. For we are
all one body, even if certain members be more resplendent
than others; and everywhere we may be
gaining forgiveness for them, by prayers, by offerings
made for them, by those who are named with them.
Why, then, do you grieve and weep, when you are
able to apply so great a forgiveness to him who has
departed? Is it because you have become lonely,
and have lost your protector? But you ought never
to say this, because you have not lost God. As long
as you possess Him, He will be more to you than
any man, be he father, child, or near relation; for
even when these were living, it was He in reality
Who did everything.</p>

<h3 id="c58"><span class="sc">The Tombs of the Martyrs.</span>
<br />(<i>Homily on the Martyrs, Benedictine Edition</i>, t. ii., p. 667.)</h3>
<p>The feasts of the martyrs are not according to the
course of days only, but they are reckoned also by
the disposition of those who celebrate them. For
instance, have you imitated a martyr, have you
emulated his goodness, have you pressed on in the
footsteps of his ascetic life? Then, though it is not
a martyr&rsquo;s day, you have celebrated a martyr&rsquo;s feast.
For to honour a martyr is to imitate him. Just as
evil-doers are feastless in the midst of feasts, so the
righteous, even if there be no solemnity, have carried
out one. The feast is characterised by purity of
conscience. This Paul expressed clearly: <i>Therefore,
let us keep the feast not in the old leaven of evil
and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of
purity and truth</i>. There is, then, unleavened
bread amongst the Jews, and so there is amongst us;
but with them it consists of wheaten flour, with us
in a pure life and in remaining spotless. Thus, he
who wards off every stain keeps a feast every day, is
ever celebrating a solemnity not only on the feast of
the martyr or at his shrine, but also sitting at home.
Every man can keep the martyr&rsquo;s feast by himself.
In saying this I do not mean that we should <i>not</i> go
to the tombs of the martyrs. I mean that, being
there, we should frequent these places with befitting
devotion, not only on their days, but that we should
show the same piety out of their days. Who would
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
not revere this gathering of ours to-day, this splendid
sight, the fervent charity and glowing spirit, the
boundless love, which are here manifested? Nearly
all the city has been eager to come; fear of his
master has not withheld the servant; no straits of
poverty, no feebleness of age, have kept the poor or
the old away; no tenderness of sex in women, no
extreme of luxury has hindered the rich, no folly of
power the ruler. But a longing for the martyrs
vanquishing all such disparity, both the weakness of
nature and the stress of poverty hold together by
one bond the vast multitude gathered here, who are
moved by the wings of this desire to live the life of
the heavenly citizens. For, treading under foot all
allurements to excess and wickedness, you are
consumed with longing for the martyrs. As with
the dawn of day wild animals flee away and take
shelter in their own holes, so when the light of the
martyrs bursts upon our minds all diseases are put
to flight and the bright flame of mortification is
enkindled. And let us keep this fire alive not now
only, but always, when this spiritual spectacle has
been broken up; let us retire to our own homes with
the same fervour, not giving ourselves up to taverns,
or dissoluteness, or drunkenness, or feastings. You
have made night into day through these sacred
vigils: do not again make day into night through
inebriation, and gluttony, and meretricious songs.
You have honoured the martyrs by your presence,
your attention, and your fervour: honour them by
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
going modestly home, lest anyone seeing you taking
your ease in a low place should say that you came
not on account of the martyrs, but to increase your
passion and to incite your bad desires. This I say,
prohibiting not feasting but sin, prohibiting not wine
but drunkenness. It is not the wine which is evil,
it is intemperance. Wine is the gift of God, intemperance
is the devil&rsquo;s invention.... Intemperance
is ever an evil, beloved brethren, and most of
all on the feast day of the martyrs. Together with
the sin, it is a most open contempt and folly and
putting aside of the divine words; hence the chastisement
would be double. If, therefore, you have come
to the martyrs and mean afterwards to drink, you
had better remain at home and not shame nor insult
the martyrs&rsquo; feast, nor scandalise your neighbour, nor
distort your understanding, nor add to your sins.
You came to look upon men who were racked with
torments, covered with blood, and adorned with
wounds, who gave up this present life and took their
flight to the life above. Show yourself worthy of
those wrestlers. <i>They</i> despised life, do <i>you</i> despise
luxury; they renounced their life in this world, do
you renounce the craving for drink. Do you wish
for feasting? Remain by the martyr&rsquo;s tomb, weep
there a fountain of tears, grieve in your mind, take a
blessing from that tomb. Let it assist you in your
prayers; make the account of his fight your constant
reading; embrace the coffin; nail yourself to the
shrine. Not only the bones of the martyrs, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
their tombs also and their coffins, produce an
abundant blessing. Take holy oil and sign your
whole body with it, your tongue, your lips, your
throat and eyes, and you will avoid the abyss of
drunkenness.</p>

<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Yesterday was the martyrs&rsquo; feast, and so is to-day.
Would that we could be always keeping the feast of the
martyrs! For if those who are mad after theatres,
and who gape open-mouthed at horses racing, cannot
have enough of those foolish spectacles, how much
more should we be insatiable for the feasts of the
saints. In the one place there is a diabolical pomp,
in the other a Christian feast: in the one place devils
are revelling, in the other angelic choirs are singing:
in the one place souls are lost, in the other there is
salvation for all who are gathered together. Do not
theatres offer any pleasure at all? If they do, not
such as the other. What pleasure, indeed, is there in
seeing horses running senselessly to and fro? In
the other case, you see, not brute animals yoked
together, but countless chariots of martyrs, and God
as charioteer in the midst of them, leading the way
to heaven. Listen to the prophet saying that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
souls of the saints are God&rsquo;s chariot: <i>God&rsquo;s chariots
are ten thousand fold, and thousands those who rejoice</i>.
That which He has made a gift to the powers above,
He has granted to our nature also. He sits upon the
cherubim, as the psalm says: <i>He ascended upon the
cherubim, and He flew</i>; and again: <i>He who sitteth upon
the cherubim and looketh into the abysses</i>. This He has
given to us also. He sits on them, He dwells in us.
<i>I will abide in you and will walk in you</i>, He says. They
have become His chariot, let us become His temple.
See you how these honours are akin? See you how
He has reconciled the things above and the things
below? Therefore, if we choose, we are in nothing
removed from the angels! As I began by saying,
yesterday was the martyrs&rsquo; feast, and to-day is the
martyrs&rsquo; feast: not the martyrs who are amongst us
here, but those who are in the country, or rather,
they also are with us. Town and country, in the
business of this life, are distinct from each other, but
as far as piety is concerned, they meet on the same
ground. Tell me not, then, that they have the tongue
of barbarians: look rather at their mortified minds.
How does unity of language serve me where the
spirit is not one? How does a different speech hurt
me where there is harmony in the things of faith?
According to this reasoning, the country is in no sort
of way worse off than the town: they enjoy equality
of privileges in the head and chief of good things.
So it was that Our Lord Jesus Christ did not confine
Himself to cities, and leave country places empty
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
and deserted, but He went about through cities and
villages, preaching the Gospel, and curing every
sickness and disease.... This is why God sowed
martyrs not in cities alone, but in the country too, so
that we may use their feasts as a necessary opportunity
of meeting each other, and oftener in the country
than in the city. For God gave the greater honour to
the inferior, as this member is weaker, and therefore
enjoyed more attention. Dwellers in towns always
have the benefit of teaching at their command, but
not so those who live in remote places. God,
therefore, comforting the poverty of the teachers in
the fruitfulness of the martyrs, has ordained that the
greater number should be buried in the country.
They have not always the voice of teachers, but the
voice of the martyr speaking to them from his tomb,
and with more force. And that you may know that
the martyrs speak more powerfully in their silence
than we by our voice, it has often happened that
many have discoursed to multitudes concerning
goodness, and have effected nothing; whilst others,
who said no word, have done wonders through the
shining example of their life. Much more have the
martyrs effected this, not raising the voice of their
body, but the voice of their deeds, which is far louder
than the voice of the mouth. Through this voice
they speak to everyone of the human race in these
words: &lsquo;Look at us, and see what evils we have
endured. What have we suffered in being condemned
to death, and finding eternal life? We have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
made worthy to lay down our bodies for Christ. If
we had not offered them up then for Christ, in a little
while we should have been obliged to put off this
temporary life of theirs in spite of ourselves.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> If
martyrdom had not come upon us, the common death
of nature would have dissolved our bodies. On this
account we give thanks to God without ceasing for
making us worthy to use inevitable death for the
salvation of our souls, and for receiving as a gift from
us, and with the greatest honour, that which was a
matter of necessity. Are the torments oppressive
and painful? If they are, they pass away in a
moment of time, whilst the refreshment lasts during
eternal ages. Nor are the torments painful even for
one moment to those who have their eyes on what
is to come, and who gaze intently upon the Judge.
Because blessed Stephen saw Christ with the eyes
of faith, he was not conscious of the volley of stones,
but instead of the stones he was counting the rewards
and crowns. So do you rise above present things to
the contemplation of the future, and you will be insensible
to even a brief consciousness of pain. This
and much more is what the martyrs say, and they
are far more persuasive than we are. For if I tell
you that torment is not torment, my words are not
to be trusted, for there is no difficulty about talking
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
wisely. But the martyr, who speaks by his deeds,
cannot be gainsaid. And, as with ordinary baths,
when they are bubbling over with hot water, no one
has the courage to jump in, as long as those who are
sitting by the bath invite each other to enter by word
only, they induce nobody to try. But as soon as one
of them puts in either his hand or his foot, and, encouraged
by the attempt, plunges in his whole body,
by his silence he persuades those outside, more than
the others by all they say, to try the bath; and so it
is with the martyrs. In their case we have the stake
instead of the bath. Those outside, by all their talk,
do not carry much weight; yet, if a single martyr
plunge in, not his foot nor his hand alone, but his
whole body, he offers by his action something more
forcible than any advice or preaching, and he stops
the anxiety of those standing round. See you how
the voice of the martyr is more powerful even in its
silence? This is why God has left us their bodies.
This is why, victorious of old, they have not yet risen.
Combats, indeed, they endured not long ago, but they
have not yet enjoyed the resurrection, and this for your
greater benefit, that you, pondering that fight of theirs,
may be incited to carry out your own race. They do
not suffer in the least from the delay, whilst <i>your</i> profit
is immense. After these things they will receive their
reward, even if they do not now. If God were to
take them away from us at this present time, He
would cut off much strength and consolation;
because true strength and consolation come to all
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
men from the tombs of the saints, and you are
witnesses of what I say. For often when we have
used threats, kindness, tears, and exhortations, you
were not moved to fervour in prayer, but going to
the shrine, without any sermon, and merely seeing
the tombs of the saints, you shed a fountain of tears,
and warmed to your prayer although the martyr is
lying there voiceless in a deep silence. Whence,
then, comes the good to the conscience, which opens,
as it were, the floodgates of tears? It is the sight
of the martyr and the remembrance of all his good
deeds. Just as when the poor see other men who
are rich and in high offices attended by body-guards,
and enjoying great honour from the king, learn to
feel their poverty more keenly in the prosperity of
others, so is it with us when we call to mind the
fortitude which the martyrs showed towards God,
the King of all their shining example and their glory,
and remember our own sins. Their abundance
makes our grief and sorrow at our poverty more
poignant, and this consciousness shows us how far
we are left behind them: hence come our tears.
Again, God left us their bodies, so that whenever the
pressure of earthly business and cares should shroud
our minds in darkness,&mdash;for private and public
affairs are full of this,&mdash;we should leave our house,
go out of the city, bid farewell to these harassing
thoughts, and seek out the shrine. We may enjoy
the spiritual atmosphere there, forget our business,
feed on peace, have the companionship of the saints,
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
pray to Him Who is their judge for our own salvation,
pour forth many supplications, and through all
these means, lightening our conscience, may return
home in much sweetness of spirit. The biers of the
martyrs are nothing else than secure harbours, the
sources of spiritual streams, inexhaustible treasures
of wealth which are never consumed. And just as
harbours receive vessels which have been much
tossed by the waves, and place them in safety, so the
biers of the martyrs receiving these spirits of ours,
which are absorbed by the cares of life, establish
them in great peace and security. Just as streams
of cold water revive failing and scorched bodies, so
do those resting-places calm souls which are burnt
up with foul passions. The mere sight of them
quenches evil cupidity, and wasting envy, and
burning desires, and any other trouble of the same
kind, and they are superior to treasures of great
wealth. For treasures of money present many
dangers to those who find them, and when divided
into many parts become less in the distribution.
Here there is nothing of this sort, for the attainment
is without dangers. Contrary to what happens in
material treasures, this division does not diminish
<i>this</i> treasure. The former, as I said, are lessened by
being divided. Now, when these are distributed
amongst many, then it is that they most of all show
what their riches are. For such is the nature of
spiritual things that they are increased by distribution,
and become greater by division. Meadows
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
with their sight of roses and violets are not so
delightful as the tombs of the martyrs which offer to
souls who gaze upon them an indestructible and
undying delight.</p>

<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Thus God has led all the saints through tribulation
and distress, helping them on the one hand whilst
securing the rest against conceiving an unduly high
opinion of their merits. Thus it was in the beginning
that idolatries prevailed by the excessive
admiration lavished upon men, and in this way the
Roman Senate decreed Alexander to be the thirteenth
god. For it had this authority of electing
and making gods. When the whole work of Christ
became known the provincial ruler sent to enquire
whether they thought He too should be a god. They
would not agree to that, and were impatient and
angry that the power of the Crucified, bursting forth
before their vote and decree, had attracted the whole
world to its own majesty. This was ordained even
against their will, so that the divinity of Christ
might not be preached by vote of man, and that He
should not be looked upon as one of the many decreed
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
by them to be divine. For they made pugilists
gods, and the creatures of Hadrian&rsquo;s infamous
lust, whence, too, the city of Antinoos derives its
name. For, since death bears witness against mortal
nature, the devil lighted upon another way&mdash;the
immortality of the soul, to which he joined gross
flattery, and led many into impiety. What malice!
Whenever <i>we</i> bring forward this argument in its
proper place, he destroys it; but when he wishes to
make an injurious use of it himself, he sets it up
most zealously. If anyone should ask, &lsquo;How is
Alexander a god? Did he not die and die miserably?&rsquo;
He answers, &lsquo;But his spirit is immortal&rsquo;. Then you
think over in your mind the argument for immortality,
and play the philosopher in order that you
may turn men away from the God of all; but when
<i>we</i> say that this is the greatest gift of God, you
persuade those whom you cheat that we are low-minded
and cringing, and nothing better than unreasoning
animals. And if we were to say that the
Crucified lives, they would indulge in great laughter
at us, although the whole universe is crying out that
He does live, and did cry out of old, then by signs,
now by converts, for these successes do not belong
to a dead man; but if some one declares that
Alexander lives, you believe him, although he has no
wonder whatever to bring forward in proof of it.
&lsquo;Yes, he has,&rsquo; you reply; &lsquo;in his lifetime Alexander
did many and great deeds, for he subdued peoples
and cities, and made many victorious wars, and set
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
up trophies.&rsquo; Now, if I am able to show you things
which neither Alexander nor any other man of his
day contemplated in his lifetime, what further proof
of the resurrection do you require? That a living
man, being a king, and having an army, should carry
out wars and victories is neither astonishing nor
wonderful; but to do things so great after crucifixion
and the tomb, to do them over land and sea, this is
truly awe-inspiring, and proclaims divine and infinite
power. After his death Alexander did not hinder
his empire from dissolution, and when it had disappeared
did not bring it back again. How should
a dead man do this? Now, Christ set up His kingdom
in dying. And why do I speak of Christ, since
He gave to His disciples also to become famous after
death? Tell me, where is Alexander&rsquo;s tomb? Show
it to me and say what day he died. But the tombs
of Christ&rsquo;s servants are famous; they have taken
possession of the most royal city, and their days are
solemnly kept as a feast for the world. Whilst the
one is unknown amongst his own countrymen, even
barbarians are familiar with the other. And the
tombs of the servants of the Crucified are more
splendid than the courts of kings, not in the greatness
and beauty of the monument, though in this, too,
they are remarkable, but, what is far more, through
the devotion of those who frequent them. And he
who is clothed in the royal purple leaves his throne
to embrace those tombs, and, putting off the garb of
vanity, stands as a suppliant of the saints in order to
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
make them his intercessors with God, and the
crowned king has need of a dead tent-maker and a
fisherman as patrons. I ask you, would you dare to
call the Lord of these a dead man, Whose servants,
though no longer here, are the protectors of the
kings of the earth? And you may see this happening
not in Rome alone, but also in Constantinople.
For here, too, the son thought his father, Constantine
the Great, most highly honoured if he might be
buried in the vestibule of the Fisherman. What
door-keepers in palaces are to kings, this kings are
at the tombs of fishermen. The fishermen, like
lords of the spot, have taken possession of what is
within; the kings, like sojourners and neighbours,
have been contented to have a separate place in the
doorway, thus proving to unbelievers that pre-eminence
in the resurrection will belong to fishermen.
For if it be so here in the matter of tombs,
how much more in the resurrection. And the order
is reversed: kings become servants and subjects,
whilst subjects are invested with regal dignity, or
rather with something even greater. The truth
itself shows that there is no flattery in the matter,
for kings have become famous through these subjects
of theirs. Their tombs are far more awe-inspiring
than those of all kings put together; there is great
solitude in the one and a great crowd at the other.
If you wish to compare these tombs with royal
courts, here again they carry off the palm. Many
are the bustling people at the court, but at the tomb
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
many are they who call and attract rich and poor,
men and women, slaves and freemen. There is
great fear at the one, and an unspeakable delight at
the other. But it is a pleasant sight to look upon
the king with his golden sceptre and his crown on
his head, his guards standing near, and princes, and
generals, and commanders, and officers high and low.
Yet the spectacle presented by the other is so much
more magnificent and ineffable, that, compared to it,
the court would seem to be a puppet show and
child&rsquo;s play. You have hardly crossed the threshold
when the place carries your mind up to heaven, to
the King above, to the army of the angels, to the
throne of the Most High, to glory unspeakable. At
court it falls to the ruler&rsquo;s part to release one man
and to put another in chains; now, the bones of the
saints have not this poor and miserable authority,
but a power far greater. For they call forth demons
and torture them, and release from their sharpest
chains those who are bound. What is more awful
than this tribunal? Whilst no one is seen and no
one appears by the devil&rsquo;s side, there are voices and
convulsions, and blows and torments, and angry
tongues, the devil not bearing that wonderful power.
And they who carry those bodies have dominion
over bodiless spirits: dust, and bones, and ashes,
tear those invisible beings into pieces. So it is that
no man would ever go a long journey to see royal
palaces, whilst many kings have often travelled far
for this spectacle. For the testimony of the saints
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
furnishes a likeness and a symbol of the judgment to
come, devils are punished, men are chastised and set
free. See you the power of the saints even when
they are dead, and the weakness of sinners even
whilst living? Fly therefore from evil, that you
may have dominion over these, and pursue goodness
with all zeal. For, if things so wonderful take place
here, judge what it will be like hereafter.</p>

<br />PERSONAL.</h2>
<h3 id="c61"><span class="sc">To Innocent, Bishop of Rome.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></h3>
<p>To my most reverend Lord, and the most religious
Bishop Innocent, John sends greeting in the Lord.</p>
<p>I think that before the reception of our letters
your Piety will have heard of the iniquitous deed
which has been attempted here; for the enormity
of the evil has allowed scarcely a part of the world
to be in ignorance of this direful tragedy. Report,
carrying news of what has taken place to the
farthest extremities of the earth, has everywhere
called forth much wailing and lamentation. Since,
however, it is not a question of tears alone, but of
setting things straight and trying to find out how this
most cruel tempest inflicted on the Church is to
be stayed, I deem it necessary to urge my most
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
honoured and reverend lords and bishops Demetrius,
Pansophius, Pappo, and Eugenius to give up their
own affairs, to brave the seas, and to set out on a long
journey, and to hasten to your Charity, so that, when
you have been clearly informed of all things, a
remedy may be more speedily applied. With these
we shall send the most esteemed and beloved of the
deacons, Paul and Cyriacus. And I myself in the
shape of a letter will inform your Charity briefly of
what has taken place. Theophilus, being bishop of
Alexandria, and certain men setting our most
religious emperor against him, he was ordered
to come here alone. Accompanied by not a
few Egyptian bishops, he makes his appearance, as
if wishing from the first to show that he comes to
war and to fight us. Then, when he had arrived at
great and heaven-favoured Constantinople, he did
not come to the cathedral according to custom and
old-established usage, nor did he visit us, nor did he
take part in sermon, prayer, or communion, but on
disembarking he passed by the vestibule of the
church and established himself at a distance from
the city, although we repeatedly invited him and
those with him to stay with us, for lodgings and
everything else needful for him were in readiness;
neither they nor he would hear of it. Seeing this, I
was much perplexed, not being able to imagine the
cause of this unjust enmity. Still, we did our part
and what was incumbent on us for them, and
continually invited him to meet us and to say why
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
he had thus made a quarrel with us from the very
first and brought discord into so great a city. As he
would not explain the reason, and as his accusers
were urgent, our most religious emperor summoned
us. He ordered me forthwith to go to the place
where Theophilus was, and to hear the case against
him. His accusers were urging assaults, and
slaughterings, and numberless other things. We,
however, who know the laws of our fathers, and
reverence and honour the man, and having his own
letters, too, to show that causes should not be
carried out of their proper jurisdiction, but that
matters concerning the province should be concluded
in the province, did not accept the task of judging
him, but declined with much firmness. He, on the
contrary, adding to his previous conduct, summoned
our archdeacon most peremptorily, as if the church
were already widowed and without a bishop, and
through him gained all the clergy to his side. So
the churches became deserted, abandoned in each
case by the clergy, who were preparing to take
action against us and to accuse us. This done, he
sent to summon us into court, though he had not
cleared himself from the charges made against him,
which was manifestly against every canon and every
law. Now, we, knowing perfectly well that we were
invited, not to a court of justice, or we would have
gone a thousand times over, but to a foe and an
enemy, as subsequent events, no less than what
had already taken place, have proved, sent to
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
him Demetrius, bishop of Pessinus, Eulysius, bishop
of Apamea, and Lupicinus, bishop of Appiaria, and
the priests Germanus and Severus, who made
careful answer as befitting us, saying that we refused
not judgment, but an outspoken enemy and a
declared foe. For how is the man who, without
receiving a charge against me, has so acted from the
first, and held himself aloof from church communion
and prayers, and incited accusers, who has gained
the clergy to himself and emptied the cathedral, how
is he fit to mount the judge&rsquo;s throne which is not
his in any sort of way? For it does not belong to
Egypt to sit in judgment on Thrace, when, too, he
of Egypt is under accusation and a declared enemy.
Yet he showed no regard to us, being bent on carrying
out his own purposes, though we showed that we
were equal to defend ourself before a hundred or a
thousand bishops, and to prove ourself innocent, as
we are; but he would not abide it. Now, in our
absence, while we were demanding a synod and
seeking judgment, not avoiding a hearing but open
enmity, he received accusers, absolved those excommunicated
by me, and took information from those
very men who had not cleared themselves of charges,
and had it written down officially, all which acts are
against the ordinary course of custom and canon
law. Why need I go on? He left nothing untried
until he had cast us out with a high hand both
from the city and the Church, and this late in
the evening, all the people pressing after us. I was
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
taken and carried off by the <i>curiosus</i><a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> in the midst of
the city, thrown into a ship, and I sailed through
the night, all this because I had demanded a synod
for my just hearing. Who could listen to all this
with dry eyes, however stony his heart? But, as I
said, we need not only to grieve for the evil accomplished,
we must also remedy it, and therefore I
appeal to your Charity to stand by us and sorrow
with us, and to do everything you can that it may go
no further. For their illegal proceedings did not
stop here, but were aggravated by others besides
their former ones. When our most religious emperor
turned them out of the church which they had
shamefully usurped, and many bishops present seeing
their iniquity, and flying from their approach as from
a fire consuming everything, retired into their own
dioceses, we at last were recalled to the city, and to
the church from which we had been impiously cast out:
more than thirty bishops brought us back, our most
religious emperor sending a notary for the purpose,
but he (Theophilus) took immediate flight. For what
reason? Because, when we came back, we entreated
our most religious emperor to call a synod to avenge
what had taken place. Conscious, therefore, of his
deeds, and fearing to be convicted, the imperial
letters having been sent to all parts, calling all
together, he threw himself in the dead of the night
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
into a little boat, and thus escaped, taking all his
party with him. But we in the security of our conscience
did not desist from entreating our most
religious emperor as before, who with a kindness
worthy of him sent for him again from Egypt, and
for those with him, that they might give an account
of what had taken place, and that he might not
suppose the iniquitous attempt made by a party in
our absence, in the face of all canon law, should
be a sufficient excuse for himself. Yet he did not
heed the imperial letters, but stayed at home,
alleging the sedition of the people, and the untimely
zeal of some who, forsooth, were opposing
him, although before the imperial letters this same
people had rained down accusations against him.
However, we will not now enter into these things,
but we have said this much, wishing to show that
he was caught in the act of plotting. Moreover,
after this, we did not rest, but demanded a judgment
founded on enquiry and answer, for I said
we were prepared to show ourself free from
blame, and them most guilty. For certain Syrians
who had been with him at that time were left
here, and they had taken part in all his proceedings.
These we approached in our readiness
for judgment, and often repeated our demand,
asking for the documents or heads of accusation, or
to be told the nature of the grievance against us, or
who the accusers are. We could obtain none of
these things, and again we were thrust out of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
see. How shall I narrate what then happened&mdash;an
unequalled tragedy? What words will suffice?
What ear will listen untroubled? Whilst we made
the same offer, as I was saying, a great military
force collected on the great Sabbath<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> itself, and we
going into the church as the evening was drawing
on, they tore by force all our clergy from our side,
and surrounded the sanctuary with armed men.
The women in the sacred building, who had undressed
for baptism at that very time, fled away
without their clothes in fear at this terrible invasion.
Nor were they allowed to cover themselves as much
as womanly decency would require, but many of
them were wounded and thrust outside, the fonts
were filled with blood, and the sacred waters
polluted. Yet the evil did not stop even here.
Proceeding to where the holy elements were reserved,
the soldiers, amongst whom some were
known to me as not Christians,<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> looked at everything within the veil
(<span title="ta endon">&tau;&#8048; &#7956;&nu;&delta;&omicron;&nu;</span>),
and as it happens in a great tumult, the most sacred Blood of Christ was
spilt upon those soldiers, and as in a barbarian
captivity, everything was dared. The people fled
into solitude, and the multitude passed their time
outside the city, and the churches at so great a feast
became empty, and more than forty bishops, our
companions, with people and clergy, went into hiding
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
for no cause. The sighs and groans and bitter tears
called forth by these misfortunes filled marketplaces,
and houses, and deserts, and every part of
the city. Through the extreme wickedness of the
deed, not the sufferers alone, but also those who
were not sufferers in this way, sympathised with us:
not the orthodox alone, but heretics, and Jews, and
heathens. There was everywhere trouble, and
agitation, and grief, as if the city had been taken
by storm. And these things were attempted against
the intention of our most religious emperor, at
nightfall, by the machinations of bishops, who, in
many instances, led the troops, and were not
ashamed to have the attendance of civil officers
instead of deacons. When day came the whole city
was transported beyond the walls, under trees, and
in valleys, finishing the feast like straying sheep.</p>
<p>You will be able to surmise the rest, for, as I
said, it is impossible to repeat word for word what
has taken place in each case. What is so grievous
is that evils so great and crying have not yet come
to an end, and that there is no hope of liberation.
On the contrary, they increase day by day, and we
have become a laughing-stock to many. Or rather,
no man laughs, however unrighteous he may be, for
all men are in tears, as I have said, at this recent
iniquity, which is the climax of misfortune. What if
we were to speak of the troubles of the other churches?&mdash;for
the evil was not restricted to Constantinople, but
spread to the East. For just as inflammation which
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
begins in the head corrupts all the members, so now
iniquities arising from the fountainhead, as it were,
of this great city, have opened the door to a general
agitation. Everywhere priests are against bishops,
bishops against bishops, and people divided against
themselves, whilst others are brooding sedition: badness
is growing apace, and the whole world is overturned.
When you learn all this, my most honoured
and religious Lord, show forth a courage and zeal
befitting you, that so great a flood of iniquity against
the churches may be stemmed. For if this custom
should obtain, and anyone who wishes it should be
allowed free ingress into the dioceses of others at so
great a distance, to thrust out those whom he chooses,
to act on his own authority, as it pleases himself,
understand that all things will be dissolved, that the
whole world will be involved in irremediable war,
every man fighting everyone else. Now, in order
that so great a destruction should not overwhelm all
things under the sun, I beseech you to enjoin by
letter that what has been iniquitously perpetrated
against us in our absence, and by one party, whilst
we did not refuse judgment, may have no force, as
indeed it has none by its very nature, and that those
who are thus convicted may be subjected to the
penalty of ecclesiastical laws. With regard to ourself,
who have been neither condemned nor convicted,
we ask you for the continued benefit of your
letters and of your charity, and of everything else
which we previously enjoyed. If they who have
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
been so guilty would even now allege charges by
reason of which they iniquitously cast us out, not
telling us of the accusations nor making charges
against us, the accusers not appearing, let us have
an impartial judge, and we will submit ourselves to
his sentence and prove ourself guiltless of what is
brought against us, as indeed we are. Their recent
deeds are against all propriety and every law and
ecclesiastical canon. And why do I speak of ecclesiastical
canon? Not even in secular tribunals have
such things been ever attempted, nay, not amongst
barbarians: neither Scythians nor Sauromites have
ever given sentence for one party alone, in the absence
of the accused, who was refusing, not judgment, but
hatred, demanding a thousand judges, declaring himself
innocent, ready to clear himself from charges
in the face of the world, and showing that he is
blameless in everything. Considering all this, and
learning things more clearly from my lords and most
religious brethren, the bishops, I beseech you show us
that zeal which becomes your office. Thus you will
rejoice not us alone, but all churches in general, and
you will be rewarded by God, Who does all things
for their peace. Farewell, and pray for me, most
honoured and holy Lord.</p>

<p>You allege the incursion of the Isaurians as the
cause of your absence, but I look upon you as present
and myself as with you, and see no obstacle in
this against your arrival. For such are the wings of
charity that they fly swiftly and with great alacrity
in every direction, in spite of a thousand impediments.
But if I am deprived of your bodily presence,
cease not from prayer, and our merciful God
will grant it us. Since I too, bearing you constantly
in my mind, long for a sight of you in the flesh, and
I know that I shall have this too, as you are earnestly
beseeching Him Who can do all things to break up
the winter and to establish peace everywhere. Now,
to gladden you with news of myself, I am enjoying
much quiet and leisure. And although many things
disturb my health, as, for instance, the absence of
physicians and the want of necessaries (for there are
no shops here and no drugs), a bad climate (for the
summer tries me no less than the winter, by its excessive
heat as opposed to the cold), a siege severe and
constant, with perpetual fears of incursions from the
Isaurians,&mdash;in spite, I say, of all this and much more
which is undermining my strength whilst recovering
from that great danger and severe illness, I am
fairly well. Do not fail to write to me often, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
to tell me how you yourselves are. For I view
your affection as a great consolation and encouragement,
as a treasure producing a multitude of good
things. And whenever I think about your own state,
your steadfast heart, your strong and enduring love,
I cannot put it out of my mind. I take refuge in the
thought as in a spacious and calm harbour away from
the surging waves of tribulation.</p>
<h3 id="c64"><span class="sc">To some Priests and Monks in Ph&oelig;nicia, who were Instructing Heathens.</span>
<br />(<i>From Kucusus</i>, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 405. cxxiii., t. iii., p. 663.)</h3>
<p>Pilots, when they see the ocean stirred up from
its depths, and a heavy storm and disturbance, not
only do not desert the vessel, but show greater
industry and more willingness by watching themselves
and rousing the others. And physicians, too,
when they see that the fever is active and very high,
not only do not leave the sick man to himself, but
then especially do all they can, and show a greater
diligence and readiness both through others and
through themselves so as to overcome the disease.
Why do I say this? That no one of you through
the disturbance which has taken place should desire
to leave Ph&oelig;nicia and to come here for quiet. The
more the trials, the angrier the waves, the heavier
the trouble, the greater the reason for your staying
in readiness, and watchfulness, and diligence, showing
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
forth more eagerness, so that your fine house may
not fall, nor your labour be in vain, nor the fruits of
your agriculture disappear. For God is able to quell
the disturbance and to reward your patience. When
things run smoothly our reward is not so great as it
is for you now when there is much difficulty, great
agitation, and when many are scandalised. Considering,
therefore, the work done, and the labour
surmounted, and the good works which you have
accomplished, and that by the grace of God you
have conquered impiety to a certain extent, that
things in Ph&oelig;nicia had come to improve, that your
reward and crown are now greater, that God will
remove obstacles before long and give you many
compensations for your patience, stand fast and
endure. Even now you should not want for anything,
but it was my command that you should have
the same plenty and abundance, whether in clothes,
or shoes, or food, as the brethren. If I, who am in
so much tribulation and affliction in a solitude of
Kucusus, take your good deeds so much to heart,
how much should you, who are enjoying great
plenty, do your part, as far as necessity allows you.
I repeat, then, let no one frighten you, for things
gave good promise, and this you may ascertain from
the answers sent by his Reverence the priest Constantine.
If you remain, be there a thousand
obstacles, you will overcome them all. There is
nothing equal to patience and endurance; it is like
a rock. In truth, those disturbances and plottings
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
against Churches are like waves beating against a
rock, dissolving in their own foam. Consider what
the blessed Apostles suffered, both from their own
people and from strangers; how during all their
time of preaching they passed through temptations,
and dangers, and plottings, and were consumed by
prisons, and chains, and stripes, and hunger, and
nakedness. Still, dwelling in those very prisons, they
did not relinquish the stewardship entrusted to them.
Blessed Paul, in his prison, scourged, covered with
blood, fastened to the wood, in the midst of all
this suffering, gave instruction, baptised his jailor,
and left nothing unturned. Pondering on all this,
according to my counsel, stand bravely and without
flinching, with your hope on God and on His help,
which is before everything, and be careful to let me
have a detailed answer. On this account I have sent
the priest John, that he may quiet your minds, and
not suffer you to be disturbed by anyone. I have
done my part, encouraging you by words, exhorting
you by advice, and offering you plenty of necessaries,
so that you may want for nothing.</p>

<br />(<i>From Kucusus</i>, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 404. <i>Benedictine Edition</i>, cxcvii., t. iii., p. 710.)</h3>
<p>I know that you have understanding and can
reason, and that before my letter reaches you you
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
will have heard in meekness of your happy brother&rsquo;s
departure, for I would not call it death. Now, since
we, too, must do our part, I invite you, my most
honoured Lord, to show yourself as you are at this
time; not that you should not grieve, for this is
impossible, being a man clothed in flesh and looking
in vain for such a brother, but that you should
restrain your sorrow. You know the perishableness
of human things, how worldly business is like flowing
rivers, and how we should call blessed only those
who depart this life with good hope. They go not
to death, but from combat to rewards, from wrestlings
to crowns, from a storm-tossed sea to a calm
harbour. Pondering on these things, be consoled,
since my own grief is not small, and we have a
sovereign consolation in it&mdash;his goodness, which, I
think, must offer you true solace. If the departed
had been bad and full of evil, we ought to weep and
mourn for him; but being what he was, after a
life of mildness and goodness, as all the city knew
it to be, fearing what was just, showing a fitting
courage, independence, and fortitude, despising present
things, a stranger to worldly cares, we should
rejoice with him and with you that you have sent
before you <i>this</i> brother, who may place the treasure
which was his on his departure in a sure and safe
place. Do not, then, my most honoured Lord, have
any thoughts unworthy of yourself, or be broken by
grief, but show now what you are, and let me see for
my comfort that even <i>my</i> letter has done something
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
for you. So, at our great distance from each other, I
shall be proud to have overcome much of your sadness
by a mere letter.</p>

<p>Do not be sad; do not put down the beautiful
death of your happy daughter to your sins. She
has reached the waveless shore and come to everlasting
life. Removed from the troubled waters of
this present life, she stands upon the rock, and whatever
good things she has gathered together, those she
holds as a most secure treasure. You should rejoice
and exult and be glad that, like an intelligent gardener
gathering the ripe fruit, you have offered her soul to
the common Lord of all. Applying the remedy of such
thoughts as these to yourself and to my most honoured
lady, her mother, increase the reward reserved to you
under these circumstances, so that not only on account
of her excellent early training, but also for humbly and
thankfully bearing her happy departure hence, you
may receive a great crown from our merciful God.</p>

<br />(<i>On the Virginal Life</i>, ii., t. iii., p. 542.)</h3>
<p><span class="center gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>Virginity is so great a thing, and requires so much
labour, that when Christ had come down from heaven
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
in order to make men angels, and to sow the heavenly
life on earth, He did not venture even then to enjoin
it or to make a law of it, but He <i>did</i> teach death to
self, than which there is nothing harder. He taught
men to crucify themselves, always to do good to their
enemies, yet He did not make a law of virginity.
He left it to the free-will of His hearers, saying, <i>Let
him who can, take it.</i> It is a weighty undertaking: it
has arduous wrestlings with the sweat of combat,
and its path is rugged and precipitous. This is
plainly shown by those in the Old Law, who were
full of good deeds. For Moses, that great man who
summed up the prophets in his person, the intimate
friend of God, who enjoyed so much favour with
Him as to be able to snatch six hundred thousand
from the chastisement of a divine stroke, and was so
great as to command the sea, who parted the ocean,
drew water from the rock, and transformed the
atmosphere, who changed the Nile&rsquo;s waters into
blood, who opposed Pharaoh with an army of frogs
and locusts, and changed the whole face of creation,
and worked a thousand other wonders, and
many virtuous deeds,&mdash;for he was remarkable in
every way,&mdash;yet he could not even look at <i>these</i>
wrestlings, but needed marriage and the society of
his wife, with its security. He dared not launch
himself on the ocean of virginity fearing its waves.
Then there was the patriarch who immolated his
son and was strong enough to tread upon the most
tyrannical of nature&rsquo;s feelings. He had courage to
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
sacrifice his son, that son being Isaac, in the bloom
of his age, in the very flower of his youth, his own
and only-begotten son, vouchsafed to him contrary
to all hope, and full of righteousness, his one stay in
his old age. He it was who led this son forth to the
mountain for that consummation, and prepared the
altar and laid the wood upon it, who placed the
victim in readiness, and drew the sword and held it to
his son&rsquo;s neck. For he who was of adamant, or rather
harder than adamant, both held him for slaughter
and drew the knife. He who was thus firm by nature
increased his natural fortitude by the mortification
of his will, and gave proof of angelical calmness in
his deeds. Yet the man who could encounter so
great a battle, and go beyond nature itself, dared not
face the combats of virginity. He also dreaded its
wrestlings, and took to himself the comfort of marriage.</p>

<p>Nothing strange or out of the way is happening to
you, but it is extremely fitting and proper that the
strength of your spirit should be increased by constant
temptations, and your fervour and power in
combat become greater, and that you should reap
therefrom much sweetness. It is the nature of
tribulation, when it encounters a brave and ardent
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
soul, to bring about these results. And as the fire
refines gold by its action, so does tribulation purify
and refine golden souls. Therefore Paul says,
<i>Tribulation worketh patience and patience probation</i>.
Hence, I too am in joy and gladness, and in
this vast solitude am consoled by this fortitude of
yours. Therefore, even if thousands of wolves hem
you in and endless evil plottings, I have no fear;
but it is my prayer that present temptation may
pass away and that you may not encounter others,
thus fulfilling the divine law, which bids us pray not
to fall into temptation. And if, perchance, it should
happen again, I have confidence in your soul of gold,
and in the great riches which you would gain for
yourself. With what threat will they who act
against their own interests be able to frighten you?
By loss of money? But this, I know well, is like
smoke in your eyes, and is accounted more worthless
than mud by the way. Is it by exile from home
and country? But you are able to live in great and
populous cities as well as in deserts, and to pass
your time in peace and quiet, and to put away
worldly visions. Or do they threaten you with
death? This, too, has been always in your
thoughts, and if they should drag you to execution
they will find a dead body in their hands.
Why need I say more? No one will be able to do
anything to you which you have not already borne
with much patience. You, who have ever walked
on a steep and thorny path, have accustomed yourself
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
to all these things; you, who have shown
consummate skill under training, now appear more
radiant in the combat: not only are you not
troubled by what has taken place, but you are
soaring above the earth and rejoicing. You are
glad to have a part now in those combats for which
you had prepared yourself, and this in your woman&rsquo;s
body, which is weaker than a spider&rsquo;s web. Whilst
men are raging and gnashing their teeth, you are
treading their madness under foot in much cheerfulness,
and you would be ready to suffer many more
things than they could prepare against you. Blessed
and thrice-blessed are you by reason of the crowns
to come, or rather by those very wrestlings. For
these struggles, even before the reward, and in the
oppression of the fight, have their present rewards,
and compensations, and sweetness; they have contentedness,
and fortitude, and steadfastness, and
patience in making you invincible, unconquerable,
far above all; they so exercise you that you can
suffer no evil from anyone, and make you stand
upon the rock in spite of angry waves, and bear a
furious ocean with great peacefulness. These are
the rewards of tribulation, even before the kingdom
of heaven. I know that, already, you account yourself
divested of the body, on the wings of sweetness,
but that if called upon you would put it off more
easily than others do the clothes which they wear.
Rejoice, then, and be glad both over yourself and
over those who die the blessed death, who die not
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
in their bed, not in their houses, but in prisons, and
chains, and torments. Grieve only for the doers of
these things, and weep for them: this is worthy of
your virtue. Since you wish to hear about my bodily
health, I have so far got rid of the illness which
troubled me and am better now, if only winter when
it comes does not affect my weakness of stomach.
We are also in perfect security from Isaurian
invasions.</p>

<p>Would you, who have given proof of so much
mortification from your youth upwards, and have
trodden human pride under foot, expect to live a
quiet life without combat? How should this be?
For if men who are fighting other men receive a
thousand wounds in combats and wars, you who
have been armed against principalities, and powers,
and the lords of darkness in this world, against
spiritual forces of wickedness, who have fought thus
valiantly, and set up victorious trophies, and thus
vexed the devil,&mdash;how should you hope to lead a
peaceful and untroubled life? Therefore you should
not be disquieted because battles, and agitation, and
fears assail you on every side. You should wonder,
on the contrary, if none of these things came to pass.
Labour and peril are the lot of goodness. You knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
this well enough before my letter, and do not need
to learn it from others. I write this, then, since I
am not instructing one who is ignorant. For we
know that neither banishment from our country
nor the loss of money, though insupportable to most
men&mdash;neither contempt nor any other suffering of
the kind, will be able to disturb you. For if the
companions of those who have suffered these things
have become enviable, how much more those who
are actually suffering them? Therefore, on both
accounts, Paul proclaims believers amongst the
Hebrews, saying: <i>Call to mind the former days, wherein,
being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions,
and on the one hand, indeed, by reproaches and
tribulations, were made a gazing-stock, and on the other
became companions of them that were used in such sort.</i>
Therefore, there is no need for <i>me</i> to write a long
letter. No man, indeed, goes to offer assistance to
a conqueror who holds a splendid trophy of victory
in his hands, but only praise. I, too, know how
much interior spirit you have shown in what has
befallen you. I account you blessed, and admire
you for your patience in the present, as well as for
the rewards which it will bring to you. I am well
aware, however, that you wish to hear how I am
getting on, for I have been silent for a very long
time. I have thrown off the violence of my illness,
but still feel its effects. I have had excellent physicians,
yet the want of necessaries destroys the good
of my cure. For not only are there no remedies
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
here, and no one of the things required for a
suffering body, but both famine and pestilence are
imminent.</p>

<p>You greatly refreshed me and made me rejoice,
when, in telling me of your misfortunes, you added
the word, which we should always say in everything
befalling us: &lsquo;Glory be to God in all things&rsquo;. This is
a stroke which hits the devil in the right place; this
is great security and happiness in every danger to
the man who utters it. In giving voice to it, dark
despondency vanishes. Cease not, then, from saying
it and from teaching it to others. Thus a destructive
storm, even should it increase in fury, will be changed
into peace; thus the storm-tossed will reap a greater
reward, whilst they are also removed from evils.
This it was which crowned Job; this word overthrew
the devil, and made him retire in confusion; this
removes all anxiety. Continue, therefore, to use it
on all occasions. Let no one be in trouble about
this place. For if Kucusus be indeed a solitude, I
enjoy much quiet there, and I have been able to cure
a large part of the no small infirmity contracted
through weakness on my journey, by sitting constantly
in the house.</p>

<h3 id="c71"><span class="sc">Vanity of Vanities.</span>
<br />(<i>Homily on Eutropius</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> <i>Benedictine Edition</i>, tom. iii., p. 381.)</h3>
<p>At all times, but especially now, it is pertinent to
say, <i>Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity</i>. Where is
now that splendid consulship, those magnificent
torches and applauding assemblies, those balls and
banquets and stately feasts? Where are those
crowns and curtains, those gatherings of a whole
city, the cheerings of amphitheatres, the flatteries of
crowded houses? All these things have vanished:
a mighty gale has blown down the leaves, and shown
us a naked tree, one shaken from its foundations.
Such has been the force of the wind that, after
sapping the tree&rsquo;s life, it threatens to tear it up by the
roots. Where are now those false friends, and those
drinking parties and banquets? Where are those
swarms of parasites, that wine which never ceased
flowing all day long, those wonderful dishes produced
by the cooks, those servants of the consulate,&mdash;all
those who spoke and acted to curry favour? They
were a night&rsquo;s dream, and they vanished with the
daylight; they were spring blossoms scorched by
summer heat: they were passing shadows, dissolving
smoke, bubbles which have burst, a cobweb torn away.
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
Therefore I would put before you the frequent use
of those spiritual words: <i>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity</i>.</p>
<p>These are words which should be engraved on
walls, on clothes, on the market-place, in dwelling-houses,
by the wayside, on doors and thresholds, and,
most of all, in the conscience of each one of us, which
we should regard through everything, since trickery
and masks and hypocrisy seem to be truth amongst
the majority of men. These are words which every
man should speak to his neighbour both at the
morning and the evening meal, and at meetings, and
which he should hear from others: <i>Vanity of vanities,
and all is vanity</i>. Was I not always telling you that
riches are fleeting? You would not believe me.
Did I not tell you that wealth is an arrogant companion?
You would not be persuaded. Now, a
personal experience has shown you that it is not
only fleeting, not only arrogant, but also murderous,
for it has caused your fear and trembling at this
hour. Did I not tell you, when you so often
reproached me for speaking the truth to your face,
that I loved you better than your flatterers? Am
not I, your reprover, in greater trouble about you
than those who fawned upon you? Did I not add
to these words that the wounds inflicted by a friend
are more to be trusted than the kisses of enemies?
If you had borne my wounds those kisses of theirs
would not now have brought forth death, for <i>my</i>
wounds work health, whereas their kisses prepared
a fatal disease! Where are now your cup-bearers?
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
Where are those who cleared the market-place
before you, and who were full of your praises in the
crowd? They have fled, and given up your friendship;
they provide for their own safety at the cost
of your agony. It is not so with us, but we would
not be rebuffed even when you did not want us, and
now that you have fallen we stand by you and
protect you. That Church, which was warred upon
by you, has opened her heart to receive you; whereas
those fostered theatres, which you often fought us
about, have delivered you up to destruction. Still
we ceased not to say, &lsquo;Why do you act thus? You
rage against the Church and are walking towards a
precipice,&rsquo; and you heeded nothing. Yet the races,
those squanderers of your wealth, have sharpened
their sword against you, whilst the Church, the
object of your unseemly wrath, hastens to meet you,
wishing to rescue you from their wiles.</p>
<p>I say these things now, not desiring to insult the
fallen, but in order to increase the security of those
who have not fallen: not to tear open the sores of
the wounded, but to maintain in sound health those
who are not wounded: not to shipwreck the man
tossed by the waves, but to warn those who are
sailing in calm seas so that they may avoid sinking.
How can this be done? By taking to heart the
vicissitudes of human things. For if <i>this</i> man had
feared a change of fortune, it would not have come
upon him, but neither his own lot nor that of others
improved him: now do you who are nursing your
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
riches gather your lesson from this man&rsquo;s misfortune,
for nothing is more insecure than human things.
Consequently, if a man were to call them neediness
itself, he would say less than the truth, whether he
liken them to smoke or mire, or a dream, or spring
blossoms, or anything else, so perishable are they,
and so less than nothing. That nothingness has
indeed much that is insecure is evident from this:
who was ever a mightier man than he? Did he not
surpass the whole world by his wealth? Did he not
rise to the height of honours? Did not all men
hold him in fear and awe? Yet see, he is more
miserable than slaves, and more to be pitied than
menials, in greater want than the poor who are
pinched with hunger, having before his eyes day by
day swords pointed at him, and dungeons and
executioners, and the road leading to death. Nor
does he enjoy the memory of his past pleasure, nor
is he conscious even of the light; but in the midst of
day, as if in darkest night, encompassed by anguish,
he is deprived of his sight. Try as I will, however,
I cannot measure that suffering by words, which
delivers him up to an hourly expectation of death.
But what need is there of our words since he bears
them distinctly written on himself for us, as if
engraven on a statue? For yesterday men came to
him from the imperial court, wishing to drag him
away by force, and he took refuge amongst the sacred
vessels: he looked already nothing better than a
dead man, his teeth were chattering, his whole body
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
shivering and trembling, his voice was broken, his
tongue faltering, and he himself as if the life in him
had turned to stone.</p>
<p>I say these things, not in scorn nor in reproach at
his misfortune, but in the wish to soften your judgment,
and to enkindle your pity, and to persuade you
to be satisfied with the chastisement already inflicted.
For there are amongst you many inhuman men who
would even reproach me for receiving him at the
sanctuary. I should desire to soften their cruelty by
dwelling on the sufferings of this man. Why do you
reproach me, beloved brethren? Because, you say,
he who warred incessantly against the Church has
found shelter in it. For this very reason you should
have praised God the more for allowing him to fall
into a need so great as to learn both the power and
the kindness of the Church: the power, on the one
hand, to outlive so overwhelming a reverse inflicted
by his enemies, and the kindness with which she
who was persecuted extends her shield, and covers
him with her own wings, putting him in perfect
security, and bearing no memory of former things,
but opening her heart to him with the most tender
love. This is more wonderful than any trophy, this
is a magnificent victory: by this the heathen is converted
and even the Jew put to shame: this it is
which shows forth the brightness of her countenance;
that, taking her foe captive, she spares him; that
whereas all men forsake him, she alone, as a tender
mother, hides him in her own sanctuary curtains,
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
and encounters imperial wrath, an angry populace,
a boundless hatred, on his account. This is the
altar&rsquo;s adornment. What adornment is it, you ask,
that the man who is abominable, and avaricious, and
cursed, should touch the altar? Speak not thus,
since the harlot too touched the feet of Christ, and
she was indeed full of sin and impurity, yet it was
no reproach to Jesus, but a great wonder and song
of praise, for she who was unclean did not defile the
Holy One; on the contrary, He, the Good and the
Pure, made that abandoned harlot clean through
His touch. Do not bear malice, O man. We are
servants of Him Who was crucified, and Who said,
<i>Forgive them, for they know not what they do</i>. &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
you say, &lsquo;it was he who, by various laws and regulations,
cut off flight to the altar.&rsquo; Consider, then,
that experience has taught him the value of his own
action, and he himself has been the first to break the
law which he made. He has become a spectacle to
the world, and in his silence he raises a voice of
warning to all men, &lsquo;Do not likewise, that you may
not suffer in like manner&rsquo;. Through his misfortune
he has become a teacher, and through it the altar
sends forth a great radiance. It is now especially
terrible, and evident to all men, because it holds the
lion in chains. The royal statue would be greatly
adorned, not so much by depicting the king as he
sits on the throne, clothed in purple, and wearing
his crown, as by barbarians under the royal feet,
with their hands tied behind them and their faces
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
to the ground. You yourselves, in your eagerness to
come here, can testify that he has spoken no word,
for indeed the spectacle before us to-day is noteworthy,
and I see here as many people collected
together as in the holy Easter festival. He in his
silence has called them; his deeds have spoken
louder than the voice of a trumpet. You have
come here, virgins from your chambers, women
from your drawing-rooms, men leaving the marketplace
deserted, that you may contemplate human
nature convicted, and see the perishableness of
earthly things laid bare, the shameful spectacle
of that which was yesterday, and but lately so
brilliant. So much for the success born of avarice,
which is more shamefaced than any old woman&rsquo;s
blotches: the change of fortune has passed over
it like a sponge, and wiped away both paint and
titles.</p>
<p>Such is the power of this catastrophe: it has
made him who was conspicuous and illustrious now
appear more miserable than all. If the rich man
come in, he will be taught much, for, contemplating
him, who had the whole world at his command,
thrown down from so mighty a height, trodden
under foot, fallen lower than a hare or a frog,
fastened without chains to this pillar, and done to
death by fear in his anguish though unfettered, he
restrains his wrath, humbles his pride, and draws
that lesson of wisdom which it behoves him to draw,
from human things, and so goes away, learning by
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
facts what the Scripture speaks of in the words, <i>All
flesh is grass, and all human glory as the flower of
the field</i>, that the grass has been burnt up and the
flower thrown away: that man shall be burnt up as
swiftly as grass, and trodden under foot as quickly as
the flower of the field: that our days are like smoke,
and so on. In his turn, the poor man comes in, and,
gazing at this spectacle, he does not despair of himself,
nor is he afflicted at his own poverty, but he is
thankful to his neediness for providing him with a
place of refuge, and a calm harbour, and a wall of
strength. And often, seeing these things, he would
prefer to remain where he is, rather than to have all
things for a short time, and then to be in danger
of his life. See you how this man&rsquo;s flight hither is
no small advantage to the rich and poor alike, to
small people and great people, to bondsmen and freemen?
See how each one has gone away with his
own lesson drawn from the sight alone? Now,
have I succeeded in softening your passion and
putting an end to your anger? Have I extinguished
your inhumanity and enkindled sympathy within
you? Indeed, I think so, for your faces show it,
and your tears. If, then, your stony hearts have
been softened and mellowed, put forth also the fruit
of alms-giving, and, showing the ear of sympathy, let
us solicit the emperor, or rather let us call upon our
merciful God to mitigate the emperor&rsquo;s wrath, and
to make him kind, so that he may grant us a full
pardon. Already, indeed, since the day of his flight,
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
there has been no small change; for when the
emperor learnt that he had taken refuge in this
place, in the presence of the soldiers who were
incited against his crimes and preparing to put him
to death, he made a long speech. In it he quieted
their anger, alleging not only this man&rsquo;s delinquencies,
but giving him credit for whatever good he had
done, and calling upon them to show him mercy in
the one case, and in the other to pardon him as a
man. Upon their again urging him to avenge the
insulter of the emperor, crying out, stamping with
their feet, threatening him with death, and brandishing
their spears, he drew floods of tears from the
driest eyes, and, reminding them of the sacred table
to which he had fled, he put an end to their
anger.</p>
<p>Let us, then, do our part also, for what excuse
would you have if the emperor, when insulted,
bears no malice, and you who are not insulted
should be thus angry? How, when this spectacle
is removed, would you approach the mysteries and
recite that prayer in which we are commanded
to say, &lsquo;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who have trespassed against us,&rsquo; whilst
you are calling for revenge against <i>your</i> trespassers?
Did he commit great injustice and look
down upon all? I do not deny it, but this is no
time for judgment, this is the time for mercy;
not for chastisement, but for kindness; not for
examination, but for concession; not for strict
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
justice, but for pity and kindness. Therefore, let
no man be wrathful nor discontented; rather let
us supplicate our merciful God to grant him a period
of life, and to snatch him from impending death, so
that he may redeem his transgressions. Let us go
together to our merciful emperor, entreating him, by
the Church and by the altar, to release that one
man who is seeking refuge at the sacred table. If
we do this, the emperor too will approve, and God
will ratify the emperor&rsquo;s decision, and He will give
us a great reward for our mercy. For in proportion
as He turns away from the hard and inhuman man,
and hates him, so does He protect and cherish the
kind and merciful man. If he be a just man also,
God holds brighter crowns in reserve for him: if he
has sinned, He overlooks his iniquities, and gives
him this great reward for his kindness to his fellow-man.
<i>I desire mercy and not sacrifice</i>, He says. And
everywhere in the Scripture you find Him seeking for
this and saying that it is the remission of sins. So,
then, we shall make Him merciful to ourselves, and
atone for our own sins. Thus we shall adorn the
Church, and win the applause of our merciful emperor,
as I was saying, and all the people will rejoice: the
ends of the earth will be in admiration at the kind
and gentle spirit of our city, and throughout the
whole world those who hear what has taken place
will sing our praises. In order that we may enjoy
these goods, let us fall down on our knees in
supplication, entreat, beseech; let us shield the
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
captive from danger, from flight, from death, so
that we ourselves may enjoy lasting goods by
the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to Whom be glory and might, now and for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>
